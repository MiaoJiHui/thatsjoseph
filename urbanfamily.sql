Students can almost smell the chlorine of the swimming pool wafting through the barbeque-laden air, while parents are scrambling to find that perfect summer opportunity for their children. But before Junior can act on any more plots to sink his sister with that perfect cannonball, we are reminded that there are still three very important months left in the school year. &nbsp;<br />\r\nFor elementary and secondary school students, the goals of these final few months are significantly different. While secondary students are starting to feel the pressures of standardized exams, elementary school students are making that final push in a yearlong marathon that requires them to build both endurance and discipline in their approach to studying.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what can students do to maximize study time? &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Elementary students are still learning to define what good study habits are. Parents cannot expect students to have good study habits without teaching their children first. &nbsp;Thus, parents should try as much as possible to set good examples for their children by involving themselves in the study process. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dedicate a study place and time:</strong> If your child doesn&rsquo;t already have one, designate a specific study spot. &nbsp;Set a study time and, more importantly, stick to it. &nbsp;Parents should also be sure to respect study time by creating an environment with minimal disturbance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Review study goals:</strong> Parents should discuss with students what they plan to accomplish during their study time. Once students complete their study session, they should be able to recite everything that they have learned. Create an incentive program to reward your child for setting and achieving goals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Be a model: </strong>Model good habits by showing what it means to take a task from beginning to end. Involve your child in one of your projects, like planning a shopping trip, or paying bills.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Secondary school students should start building good habits that will serve them well in college. These students should:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Review Before Studying: </strong>Students should spend the first 30 minutes reflecting on their day and setting a study game plan. By reviewing what they have learned first, students can get a sense of what they already know and what they still need to work on. If they can&rsquo;t re-tell themselves what they learned in physics that day, then they will need to devote more time reviewing that subject.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Take meaningful, regular breaks:</strong> Even the most disciplined students can zone out from time to time. &nbsp;Encourage students to recharge their batteries every 45 minutes by taking a 10-minute break before resuming their studies. Once the break is over, students should summarize what they&rsquo;ve been studying over the past hour. This self-test gives the student a sense of what they&rsquo;ve mastered and what they still need to review.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do difficult assignments first:</strong> Assess which task will require the most time and energy. Prioritize the more difficult tasks for the beginning when a student has more mental fortitude to focus.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Chunk big tasks: </strong>Projects or paper writing can be overwhelming when viewed as one large task. Students should think about &lsquo;chunking&rsquo; a big project into a series of smaller tasks, checking off each task as it is completed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With Spring Festival now behind us, it&rsquo;s time for students to make the final push for a successful finish to the school year. Implementing these study tips will not only help students gain the most from their studies, they will also ensure that students set and develop good habits for college and beyond.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// This column is sponsored by New Pathway Education, www.npathway.com.

Children&rsquo;s growing bodies absorb more lead than adults and lead exposure can leave lasting damage to a child&rsquo;s developing nervous system and other organs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traces of lead can be found everywhere &ndash; in the air, the water, the soil and even in our homes, particularly in China. The key to reducing your family&rsquo;s exposure to lead is through awareness and prevention.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lead level test is part of the routine screening done at a child&rsquo;s one-year well-child exam. Many families in China also ask for lead levels to be regularly checked in children up to age six, as there are many other possible sources of lead exposure here. Any of the foreign or local clinics should be able to test for lead levels. It is usually done initially as a finger prick, but having blood drawn offers a more accurate reading.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my practice, I&rsquo;ve seen higher lead levels among children here. The laws regulating lead just do not exist. Since the acceptable lead level has been lowered from 10 to five micrograms per deciliter in the US (in China, the levels are reported as micrograms/liter in China, so 50 and below is the acceptable range), I see many kids that fall in the 5-10 range.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important part of lead poisoning prevention is identifying and reducing sources of exposure before there is harm to your child. Children under the age of six are the most at risk of exposure because they constantly touch objects, which may be contaminated with lead or lead dust, and then put their hands in their mouth. They also swallow nonfood items.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here are several ways to prevent exposure to lead:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Ask your landlord to repaint your house with lead-free paint, or better yet, do it yourself. My husband and I did this in our apartment.<br />\r\n&bull; Test paint and dust from your home for lead.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp; Buy toys from reputable sources that you know are not painted with lead-based paint.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Regularly wash children&rsquo;s hands and toys.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Regularly mop floors and clean windows.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Prevent children from playing in bare soil. If possible provide sand boxes.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;Avoid using traditional folk medicine and cosmetics unless you know the lead content.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp; Avoid using containers or cookware unless the lead content is known. Buy cookware from reputable sources, not on the street.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp; Be aware of eating food from cans made from lead solder or drinking water that flows through pipes that were soldered with lead.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Signs and symptoms of severe lead poisoning may include: irritability, loss of appetite, weight loss, fatigue, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain, failure to thrive, memory loss. Even lower levels of lead can result in learning difficulties and lower IQ.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Treatment for lead poisoning depends on how high the lead level is. If the level is above five (50 in China), we typically recommend identifying and removing the source of exposure along with good nutrition and follow up in six months. In severe cases, chelation treatment, which involves binding the lead in the blood, is necessary.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Dr. J.

What a difference only five years makes. Can you imagine what it was like 18 years ago? For a veteran Shanghai expat like me it is truly remarkable how far the grocery experience has evolved here in Shanghai.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I arrived here in 1996, food delivery meant you sent the ayi to the wet market and she brought the vegetables back to your house. Besides the traditional street markets, there were three small Western-type grocery stores frequented by the expat population and one Carrefour located in a place so seemingly far away that I never returned to it. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original City Shop, located on Hongmei Lu, was the size of a convenience store. What I remember most was the furtive phone calls (in 1996 there were no cell phones) from neighbors when a shipment of Cheerios made it to the shelves. &ldquo;Better hurry over, I just came back with four boxes, and yes, there is cream cheese too.&rdquo; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We joke that back then we brought back suitcases of food because you couldn&rsquo;t find many Western products here. Now, we bring back suitcases of food because we can&rsquo;t afford the Western products here!&nbsp;Was I worried then about feeding my two small boys? Not really. After all, 1.3 billion Chinese were feeding themselves and their families every day. There was food here. It may have taken half a day to find it and you may not have recognized the brand, but the basics were available. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The local wet markets were just as filled with colorful fruits and vegetables as today. Everyone assumed the produce was grown organically, and not in a good way. The rumor was that the farmers used human fertilizer on the fields. I am not sure that was true, but we didn&rsquo;t eat salad for six months. It was peeled and cooked veggies and fruit for us!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest surprise to me was the milk. I had never seen milk in a box before. If I had a concern, it was how I was going to get enough calcium into my children. My boys wouldn&rsquo;t drink the box milk and, as a nutritionist, I was concerned about the safety of the Chinese fresh milk. They survived and grew well on grilled cheese and other non-milk calcium sources. Both adults now, one is 6&rsquo;2&rdquo; and his brother is 5&rsquo;10&rdquo;, both at their expected heights.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeding a family here was and is more of a process than in the US. Certainly back in the 1990s, there were fewer convenience foods and no whole wheat anything. That turned out to be a silver lining for those of us who weren&rsquo;t natural chefs; we had to be very creative to recreate the meals our families enjoyed back home. The meals were probably more wholesome in that we had to skip the box and go right to scratch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today that premise remains with me, but not because I can&rsquo;t find the box processed foods. Cooking from scratch is by all accounts healthier for us and it gives me a sense of control over what my family eats, now that the choices for meals in Shanghai are endless.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In many ways, feeding ourselves here in Shanghai has become more complex. For better or worse, there is much more information today about the food supply. The best advice I can offer for healthy eating anywhere in the world is to stick to the basics. You can&rsquo;t go wrong with a diet of real, whole foods, lots of fruits and veggies and homemade meals and treats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;<br />\r\n<em>// Margaret Keefe is a registered dietician and founder of the Shanghai Nutrition Practice Group.

Nothing makes a parent prouder than hearing their child come from the dentist&rsquo;s office flashing their pearly whites declaring, &ldquo;No cavities!&rdquo;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To find out more about fluoride, we asked dentist Rouble Rana at Shanghai United Family Hospital to give us the lowdown on fluoride and its effect on developing teeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides being added to toothpaste, in some countries fluoride is added to water. In fact, fluoridation of water has been known to reduce cavities by 50 percent and the US Center for Disease Control calls it &ldquo;one of the ten great public health achievements of the 20th century.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But in China, when most kids are drinking bottled water, fluoride must come from other sources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluoride is available in two forms for dental use: topical and systemic. Topical fluorides such as fluoride toothpaste, mouthwash, gels and varnish are applied to teeth to make them decay-resistant.&nbsp;<br />\r\nSystemic fluorides are those that are ingested (fluoride added to water, milk and salt) into the body and then absorbed by developing teeth to make them decay resistant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fluoride prevents cavities in many ways:&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Strengthens the enamel: Fluoride attaches to the calcium in a developing tooth to strengthen the enamel and make it resistant to decay, while in erupted teeth it hardens the enamel. &nbsp;<br />\r\nDemineralization and remineralization of teeth: Fluoride inhibits the loss of minerals from teeth and also encourages deposition of calcium and phosphorus to keep the tooth hard, known as remineralization.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Effects on bacteria: Fluoride affects the life cycle of bacteria that causes cavities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Studies conducted over the last 25 years have found fluoride to be safe and effective in preventing cavities.&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">However, if a child younger than five consumes too much fluoride, it may lead to fluorosis. Fluorosis is more of a cosmetic problem than an actual dental disease. It usually is mild and causes tiny white specks or streaks on teeth, which are often unnoticeable. In severe cases it leads to pitting and brown stains on teeth.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Products containing fluoride should be kept out of reach of children. Parents should dispense the toothpaste to avoid excess use.&nbsp;<br />\r\nUse only a smear of fluoride toothpaste in children younger than four and a small pea-size amount for children four to six years of age. Encourage children to spit out the paste after brushing. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The American Association of Pediatric Dentistry and the European Association of Pediatric Dentistry recommend the use of fluoride toothpaste for basic cavity prevention. Brushing twice a day &ndash; after breakfast in the morning and before bed at night &ndash; with fluoride toothpaste is recommended for everyone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many factors to be considered before recommending fluoride tablets, lozenges or drops. A child&rsquo;s age, dental cavity history, dietary habits, water fluoridation and dietary fluoride should be considered before a supplement is prescribed. Your dentist can help you recommend the right amount and source of fluoride after a thorough evaluation of these factors.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Care is taken to ensure the balance is maintained between maximizing the protective effect against the dental caries and minimizing the effects of dental fluorosis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regular dental checks are recommended for all &ndash; a first check when the first tooth erupts or before a child&rsquo;s first birthday &ndash; twice a year. During these visits your dentist may apply topical fluoride on your child&rsquo;s teeth. These come in different forms including gels or foams applied on teeth in a tray or varnish that is brushed or painted on teeth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Rouble Rana, BDS MDS, is a pediatric dentist consultant at Shanghai United Family Hospital and Clinics</em></p>'), ('1', '1', '6', '1', '<p><em>By Emily Wetzki</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>&ldquo;A library is a good place to go when you feel unhappy, for there, in a book, you may find encouragement and comfort.

Each country has unique standards and scales. API, or air pollution index, is the Chinese version of AQI.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Particulate Matter (PM) is a much more valid indicator as it tells you what pollution is made up of, including chemicals, metals and dust particles. The smaller the particle, the bigger chance they have of entering the body and causing lots of damage.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bad: PM10 - particles that are 10 micrometers can enter the lungs.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Worse: PM2.5 - particles that are 2.5 micrometers can enter the blood stream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>PM is measured in mass concentration, or the number of micrograms of PM2.5 dust per cubic meter (&micro;g/m3.) 24 hour maximum allowable levels depend on each country&rsquo;s standard.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Europe: 25 &micro;g/m3<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;United States: 35 &micro;g/m3<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;China: 75 &micro;g/m3</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shanghai averages 70-140 &micro;g/m3 and Beijing averages 90-200 &micro;g/m3.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2) Smartphone savvy</strong><br />\r\nOur favorite free app for tracking the hidden villains in the air is called China Air Pollution Index, created by Fresh Ideas studios.

A mask efficiency test conducted in Shanghai by PureLiving Indoor Environmental Solutions revealed the least effective mask is the standard cotton mask, while the most effective is the N95 model, which reduces PM 2.5 particles up to 88 percent. Make sure you replace the mask after 20 hours of use. You can purchase them in bulk from PureLiving (34692269, purelivingchina.com)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4) Indoor invaders</strong><br />\r\nDue to today&rsquo;s highly efficient, tightly sealed homes, indoor air is typically five to 10 times worse that outdoor air. You&rsquo;d be surprised at the extent of pollutants such as lead, volatile organic chemicals (VOCs), formaldehyde, allergens, radon and mold in your home. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5) How to reduce potential contamination:</strong><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Leave your shoes at the door.

Rush hour is generally considered to be between 8-10am and 5-7pm. Try to avoid these times, especially with kids. Overall, it&rsquo;s a quick, easy and affordable way to get around the city and the announcements are all in English. Plus kiddos shorter than 1.2m ride for free.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Learning the lines and where you can transfer is like a puzzle at first. Download ExploreMetro&rsquo;s app &lsquo;Explore Shanghai&rsquo;, which is available offline, has a route planner, GPS and is available in Chinese and English.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Taxi</strong><br />\r\nThere&rsquo;s a color theme in the city - the lighter the taxi the better it is. So, the white and gold cabs &ndash; Dazhong and Qiangshen - are supposedly the best. Native Shanghainese will avoid the red ones like bird flu as they&rsquo;re notorious for having bad drivers, old cars and meters which have been tampered with.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually, if the top light is on, they&rsquo;re available - light off, they&rsquo;re taken. Key word: usually. Most of the taxis will have the back door on the driver&rsquo;s side locked so avoid looking like a rookie and get in on the passenger side. If you&rsquo;re travelling alone, it&rsquo;s normal to take the front seat - a great opportunity to practice your Mandarin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Know where you&rsquo;re going before you get in. Either print out your destination (in Chinese characters, not pinyin) or have the Chinese address pulled up on your smartphone. One of our favorite apps is &lsquo;Hi Shanghai&rsquo;, which is a database of thousands of places in the city and shows the Chinese address when you turn your phone horizontally. Before exiting, always take the receipt (fappiao) - if you leave any belongings behind you can trace the car down with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Drivers</strong><br />\r\nIf you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have been provided a driver by your company, congratulations! Your life just got a lot easier. The convenience of having an air-conditioned, dry, trustworthy vehicle that knows where to take you at your beck and call is invaluable &ndash; but if you&rsquo;re footing the bill, it comes with a price tag. For a driver plus the car expect to pay 7,000 -20,000RMB/month. If you have the car and just want the driver, prices range from 2,000-8,000RMB/month, depending on age, experience and driving record. You&rsquo;ll pay a premium for an English speaking driver too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bikes</strong><br />\r\nOnce you&rsquo;ve gotten a feel for the roads and traffic patterns, or lack thereof, you might want to brave a bicycle.&nbsp; Faster and cooler than walking, above ground, and free &ndash;they&rsquo;re a great way to take it all in, and get from point A to B.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Beware though, that vehicles tend to rule the road and you must drive defensively and stay aware of your surroundings at all times. Helmets, lights, child seats and other safety equipment are essential and the Decathlon store on North Zhongshan Road is a great place to get it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Walk</strong><br />\r\nForget the phrase &lsquo;pedestrians have the right of way&rsquo;. Vehicles trump walkers, so walk at your own risk. Wait for the green man to light up, try to cross the street with the herd and remember that even when there&rsquo;s a red light for the traffic, cars can still turn right. Many cars also run the red lights so just look left, right, left, right, and hey, why not, left again. Basically, don&rsquo;t get run over - be cautious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Bus routes</strong><br />\r\nAll the destinations, maps and announcements on Shanghai buses are in Chinese so if you have a sense of adventure, pay your RMB2 and see where you end up. If you read Chinese, then it&rsquo;s a great way to get to some farther flung places the Metro don&rsquo;t reach. Within the city though, there are better options for getting around which aren&rsquo;t as cramped or confusing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ferry</strong><br />\r\nFerries from Pudong to Puxi can cost as little as half a kuai for pedestrians and it&rsquo;s a gorgeous little trip across the Huangpu River which gives a whole new perspective on the towering skyline. There are around 19 different ferry lines and over 40 ferry stations along both sides of the river so you&rsquo;re spoilt for choice. You can use your Shanghai Public Transportation Card on the ferryboats and the cost varies depending on whether you want an air-conditioned boat or not. You&rsquo;ll also pay a bit more if you want to take on a bike or motorbike.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Airports</strong><br />\r\nThe two international airports that serve Shanghai are Pudong International and Hongqiao International. Both are easily accessible by Metro (both line 2), taxi, shuttle bus or, for people traveling from Pudong, the Maglev. Know if you&rsquo;re going to terminal one or two before you go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Maglev</strong><br />\r\nThe Maglev combines the ease and comfort of a train with a colossal, adrenaline-inducing top speed of 431kmh - basically like being on a really comfortable theme park ride.

Having an ayi to help around the house or a driver to ferry you from place to place can make parenting in a foreign land a whole lot easier and more enjoyable. Having help may seem like a unusual luxury but with time, most expats adjust to having the extra hands around and find it an indispensable part of life in the Middle Kingdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Ayis</strong><br />\r\nAn ayi doesn&rsquo;t have a specifically defined role as such &ndash; they may help with your cleaning and laundry a few hours a week or they can do all the cooking, shopping and child care full-time. Every family is unique and must think about their needs and how an ayi can best help.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also important to spend time creating clear guidelines about your ayi&rsquo;s duties from the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nCecile Spirit, a seven-year expat in Shanghai and mother advises, &ldquo;From the beginning, make a list of what you want your ayi to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; She has had positive experiences with the two ayis she has employed here, but many of her friends were not clear about their expectations and ended up in frustrating situations that often lead to the ayi abruptly leaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAn ayi is not a mind reader, Spirit says, &ldquo;Be frank. Be blunt. If they have done something you don&rsquo;t agree with, tell them.&rdquo; An example Spirit gives is her friend&rsquo;s ayi who would use the same cloth to clean the toilet and the kitchen.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may have to teach them about your hygiene standards and adapting to your family&rsquo;s requirement,&rdquo; she adds.<br />\r\nFor matters of childcare, cultural differences in the way children are raised can also be an issue, so it&rsquo;s equally important to be clear about issues such as discipline, diet, routines and sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nSome families will find an ayi most helpful when children are younger, but find their needs often change.&nbsp; This has been the case for Monica Munn, an American mother of three children who has been in Shanghai five years.&nbsp; &ldquo;While having an ayi around is very helpful and there are days that I wished I had more help, as our children get older and go to school, my need for the extra help has diminished,&rdquo; says Munn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nBuilding a positive relationship with your ayi takes time, but if you properly train and communicate with your ayi, respect them and pay them well, your trust in each other will grow. For Xiao Lin, an ayi from Chongqing who has worked for four families over the past eleven years, says the best part of being an ayi, &ldquo;is feeling like I&rsquo;m part of the family,&rdquo;&nbsp; and she continues to keep in touch with the families who have left China to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nThe best way to find a good ayi is through the recommendation of expat families who are leaving and want to help their ayi find a new home. See p8 for sources for connecting with other parents, or you may even find postings in your housing complex. Hiring an ayi who has worked with other families will make the transition for all parties easier and an ayi with solid references will likely be one you can trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nAgencies are another option and can arrange interviews at your home with four to five candidates.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t speak Mandarin, the agencies can also help translate. From there you begin a trial period - usually a few days - and if you agree to hire the ayi, a contract will be signed. You have to pay a fee to the agency which can range from 10 percent of the monthly salary for local agencies to as high as 40 percent for agencies that cater to foreigners. The benefits of using an agency are having an intermediary should problems arise, and in the event the ayi doesn&rsquo;t work out, they will help you find a replacement without having to pay another fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n&nbsp;Here are some suggested questions when interviewing an ayi:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How long has she worked as an ayi and what were her previous jobs?<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;If she looked after children, what were their ages?<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Has she had a health check?<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does she know first aid?<br />\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does she speak any English?<br />\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Can she cook Chinese or Western food?<br />\r\n7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does she have children of her own and do they live with her?<br />\r\n8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Is she available to work on the weekends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Drivers</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nIf your employer doesn&rsquo;t provide a driver and car, which is the case for many expats today, finding a driver can be done in the same way as an ayi &ndash; through a car-leasing agency or the recommendations of other expats.<br />\r\nBesides helping you get to and from work, some drivers drop off and pick up children from school and others might even run errands too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\nHere are some important questions to ask of the driver:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;How long has he been a driver?<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Has he previously worked for expat families?<br />\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What traffic violations or accidents has he had?<br />\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What kind of car does he drive?<br />\r\n5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;What hours is he driver available?<br />\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Does he smoke?</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Cost</strong><br />\r\nWhen employing an ayi or driver, the contract should specify the job responsibilities and conditions of employment, as well as holidays, salary, overtime and bonus in the contract.<br />\r\nPrices of both have been steadily on the rise. If you are paying hourly for an ayi, expect to pay RMB20-25/hour. For a full-time worker, 40 or more hours per week, monthly salaries can range from RMB3800&ndash;4500, sometimes more, depending on their experience and schedule.<br />\r\nDrivers with a car can range from RMB7000-20,000 per month depending on the type of car (sedan or minivan), while gas and tolls cost extra.<br />\r\nBoth ayi and driver will likely expect to have holidays off, as well as a Chinese New Year&rsquo;s bonus which is typically one month&rsquo;s salary depending on their length of employment. Bear in mind, they will likely expect a salary increase each year too. All of these things can be negotiated, but it&rsquo;s best to be up front at the beginning of employment to avoid future problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>**MANDARIN BOX**</strong><br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Clean 干净 gānj&igrave;ng<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Dirty&nbsp;&nbsp; 脏&nbsp; zāng<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wash&nbsp; 洗 xǐ<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;once a week&nbsp;&nbsp; 一个星期一次 y&iacute;g&egrave; xīngqī y&iacute; c&igrave;<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;twice a week&nbsp; 一个星期两次 y&iacute;g&egrave; xīngqī liǎng c&igrave;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8 DIFFERENT TYPES OF AYI:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Tie Dayi<br />\r\nYou used to have white t-shirts.

Ask who will attend to management and maintenance. If it is owned by an individual overseas allow for possible delays in negotiations, payments and services.<br />\r\nPayment - If the rent agreed upon is in USD and paid in RMB, then base it on a fixed exchange rate (usually the Bank of China) and agree on a fixed total RMB amount.<br />\r\nRent &amp; security deposit &ndash; In general, one month&rsquo;s rent and two month&rsquo;s refundable security deposit are paid once the contract has been signed. Leasing contracts are a relatively new in modern China and the legal system is still evolving, so the payment of money secures the property.<br />\r\nManagement - Understand who is responsible for what as well as response times and what to do if emergency repairs are needed. Get signed reports that all the property&rsquo;s appliances have been cleaned, checked and repaired.<br />\r\nManagement fee - Property compounds employ a company for maintenance and management services. A monthly management fee is charged for these services paid by the landlord.<br />\r\nOfficial receipt - If your company needs an official receipt (fappiao), ensure this is included in the offer. Some landlords try to avoid paying tax and prefer tenants who don&rsquo;t need an official receipt. Most companies will need one if they are paying housing but if you&rsquo;re paying by yourself then you won&rsquo;t.<br />\r\nSports club card - Ensure membership is provided to the sports club and find out what is free and charged.<br />\r\nUtilities &ndash; Find out what are the approx monthly utility bills such as electricity, gas and water. Are utilities metered as user pays and is there a service fee attached to it? Who covers installation and payment of IDD and ADSL lines and how long they will take to install? What TV channels are available and who pays the satellite TV fees. &nbsp;<br />\r\nTaxes - The landlord is responsible for any business tax and property tax.<br />\r\nInsurance -The landlord is responsible for the premises and provisions and the tenant insure their own belongings.<br />\r\nLegal ownership -Ensure the landlord is the legal owner of the leased property and has all the necessary papers to prove it.<br />\r\nSale of property - Ensure that your lease remains valid if the property is sold.<br />\r\nRenovations - If the property needs renovations, ensure they are listed and added to the contract to ensure they are done by the time you move in. Instruct your agent to write a time frame of all renovations and follow up on its progress with updates. Visit the property a few times to check on quality etc. (don&rsquo;t worry if it looks like a &lsquo;war zone&rsquo;) If you are concerned about delays, add a clause that rent won&rsquo;t be charged and/or alternative accommodation will be provided if renovations aren&rsquo;t completed on time.<br />\r\nExpiration of contract - On expiration of the contract, after all bills and/or damages are paid, the deposit should be refunded in its original currency within one week.<br />\r\nAttachments - Ensure that any attachments are referred to in the contract, are an inseparable part of it and are equally enforceable.<br />\r\nDisputes - It is recommended that you negotiate to resolve any disputes that arise and get your agent involved as early as possible. There is not a highly developed legal system for disputes in China.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />\r\nLanguage - Contracts are written in both Chinese and English languages with the Chinese version having the legal power in the event of disputes.<br />\r\nLowering your rent - Rentals prices are &ldquo;asking prices.&rdquo; Final rentals are influenced by a number of criteria. A prospective tenant can get lower rentals if they follow some of the advice below: &nbsp;<br />\r\n-Pay rent on a quarterly basis<br />\r\n-Don&rsquo;t request extra items<br />\r\n-Don&rsquo;t ask to remove items<br />\r\n-Sign a longer lease term than requested i.e. two years fixed<br />\r\n-Take the property unfurnished (if not furnished)<br />\r\n-Commence the lease term as soon as possible<br />\r\n- Sign the lease and pay the rent as soon as possible<br />\r\n-Don&rsquo;t get an official tax receipt (fappiao) unless necessary</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Adrienne Farrelly is one of Shanghai&rsquo;s most experienced Expatriate Property Agents having started in the industry in 1993 and has helped countless expatriates and their families find the right home in Shanghai.

Using art history as her muse, every issue Colorbox Arts creator Monika Lin provides a project that can be done at home and incorporates a brief lesson.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this project, Claude Monet&rsquo;s impressionism is the inspiration. Using a detail from his painting &lsquo;Seine At Rouen&rsquo; you can construct a cutout collage. The project is appropriate for ages 3-12, as it can be adjusted according to abilities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Materials:</strong><br />\r\nDrawing paper<br />\r\nColored pencils or crayons<br />\r\nLarge piece of felt or paper for background<br />\r\nSmaller pieces of colored felt or foam paper for individual shapes<br />\r\nScissors<br />\r\nGlue</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n1. Begin by analyzing the image. Note how the objects and the reflections on the water are clearly defined through specific marks. These marks are not blended together but layered or set next to one another. Separate the scene by breaking down shapes into small internal or sub-shapes rather than large pieces.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Draw out the scene on a piece or paper using small marks in various directions and with different colors that build larger shapes. Pay attention to how Monet altered the length and direction of his marks according to the various objects in order to create movement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Use this drawing to help decide how to cut forms out of the felt or foam paper. Cutting smaller shapes will allow for more texture and interest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Arrange these on the background and glue them down.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Art History Lesson</strong><br />\r\nImpressionism emerged in the late 1800s. The movement is distinct in the manner in which colors are set side by side or on top of one another rather than blended. The quality of light was one of the main focuses of Impressionism and gave the majority of the paintings associated with that movement their distinct glowing quality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Claude Monet (French, 1840-1926) focused almost entirely on the play of light on objects. He produced series of artworks that examined the various seasons, times of day, water and weather such as his &lsquo;Haystacks,&rsquo; &lsquo;Boats in Rouen,&rsquo; &lsquo;Cathedrals&rsquo; and &lsquo;Water Lily&rdquo; series.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Monika Lin is an artist and the director of Colorbox.

First of all, yin and yang are out of balance in children. Yang is dominant - children are ruled by the active, hot and bright element. This translates into a tendency of being hyperactive, incapable of staying still and to have a body temperature that gets easily elevated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, in terms of health, they get sick easily, but recover very quickly. Acute diseases, which contrary to chronic diseases, arise rapidly with fever and intense symptoms, then get cured after a few days, mainly touch children. Kids react easily to medication and recover more quickly than adults, which is why they need gentle medical techniques and lower doses of medication.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to TCM, children&rsquo;s organs are not complete yet and their organism is still fragile. They have a different constitution than adults: their qi (vital energy) is weak and their organs, bones and muscles are soft and slowly maturing. Children are particularly exposed to suffer from:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Upper respiratory tract diseases (such as cold, cough, asthma and bronchitis) because their lungs are weak.<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Spleen diseases (vomiting, diarrhea, constipation) because their stomach is sensitive and their digestive system is not complete. They also tend to gain or lose weight easily.<br />\r\n-&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Liver disturbances because of excessive emotions - as in TCM the liver is associated with the emotions - resulting in children becoming easily emotionally upset with a yang excess.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Among all the factors that can cause a disease in children, the main cause is a non-adapted diet. Indeed, they have a maturing digestive system and cannot digest all types of food. Even if variety is important, forcing children to eat food items they would not want to eat is not beneficial.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Usually children naturally select the food items they know they can easily digest. They also prefer small meals at flexible times to three big meals at adult-appropriate times. Introduce variety gently. Healthy foods will enable children to develop beautifully, as well as to get used to new flavors. Generally, it is best to try to avoid uncooked, frozen and spicy food and serve meals at regular times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A TCM doctor can effectively and naturally treat the above-mentioned diseases within a short period of time. Those diseases are mainly cured with herbal medicine because it is difficult to practice acupuncture on children who might be afraid of needles and might move during treatment. Mixing in honey or apple juice can help facilitate the intake of Chinese medicine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TCM is the right solution for parents looking for a natural way to cure their children or prevent other diseases, and not expose them to Western medicine that can sometimes be too strong for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Doris Rathgeber is the founder and General Manager of Body &amp; Soul</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '28', '1', '<p><em>By Doris Rathgeber</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Childhood asthma might be more common than you think. Approximately 10 percent of children suffer from this disease, which typically develops between the age of four and five. While the causes of childhood asthma aren&#39;t fully understood, various factors include exposure to pollution, heredity and early respiratory infections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During an asthma attack, a child might first experience mild chest pressure and a dry cough, followed by bronchial spasms causing a cough and severe breathing difficulties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Acute outbreaks are triggered by infections of the upper respiratory tract or allergies. Asthma comes in different forms and levels. For less severe cases of asthma, 50 percent of children will grow out it.<br />\r\nWhile Western medicine merely controls attacks, Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) can cure the root of the asthma. Even in the most severe cases, a reduction in symptoms can usually be achieved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In TCM, asthma is called <strong><em>qi chuan bing</em></strong> or <em><strong>xiao chuan bing</strong></em>, which indicates a disease of breathing difficulties, with or without breathing noises. TCM understands asthma as due to an immune deficiency located in the lungs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lung qi (or vital energy) cannot protect the body from the intrusion of wind, cold, heat and dampness (all considered evil pathogens that cause diseases), which in turn causes phlegm accumulation in the lungs. Phlegm can cause coughing and breathing difficulties.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because children&rsquo;s lungs are slowly maturing and still weak, they are more likely to experience upper respiratory tract diseases such as asthma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Asthma attacks are most likely to occur during rapid changes of weather or when allergen levels are high (pollen, smoke, pollution, etc.). Diet can also play a role. According to TCM, some foods that are heavy, sweet and greasy, along with seafood, should be avoided.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to treat asthma properly, the TCM physician must identify the root cause of asthma (accumulation of heat, phlegm and cold fluids in the lungs) to design a treatment plan.&nbsp;<br />\r\nMost often, herbal medicines achieve positive results. If the child is old enough to remain still and is not afraid of needles, acupuncture could also be applied to treat asthma. Otherwise, Tuina massage for children is also indicated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TCM can significantly improve asthma symptoms and patients usually can live without asthma spray or any other kind of medication after three to six weeks of treatment. Maintaining a basic herbal therapy intake is generally sufficient.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In severe cases, an integrated approach is often preferable &ndash; using Western medicine to control severe attacks and TCM to treat the underlying causes. And while a cure is not always possible in all cases, improvement can almost always be observed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So next time you are wondering how to treat your child&rsquo;s asthma as naturally as possible, consider asking a TCM doctor for assistance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Doris Rathgeber is the founder and general manager of Body &amp; Soul-Medical Clinics, <a href=\"http://www.tcm-shanghai.com/\">www.tcm-shanghai.com</a>.&nbsp;</em></p>'), ('1', '1', '29', '1', '<p><em>By Jodi Hwang, Photos by Elliot deBruyn</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you are an experienced yogi or have never done a downward dog, a family yoga practice can help parents and children unwind and connect. Family yoga might not always look like a traditional yoga practice and requires a little more creativity and fun to keep little ones interested. Setting aside a half hour or more to come together in a healthy and non-competitive setting &ndash; a break from the hurried overscheduled pace most families have - will leave everyone more relaxed and breathing easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If bad weather or heavy pollution has your children stuck inside, make some room for your family to move together.&nbsp;Yoga done together might also redirect energy if the kids are acting out or bouncing off the walls from cabin fever. In warmer weather, family yoga could also be done outside in a grassy area or on a holiday at the beach.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A family yoga practice could be structured similar to regular yoga classes with a warm-up, some playful active poses, a few balance or partner poses and ending with relaxation. Keep the flow natural and be flexible if one member of the family is uninterested or struggling to keep up. In the end, you&rsquo;ll feel more bonded if everyone is included. For parents, it&rsquo;s also a chance to be present and open up to the kid inside of you.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To inspire your family to try yoga together, we asked Shanghai residents Pablo Carriquiry Gomez and Maria Ricucci and their children Miguel, 9, Martina, 4, and Gabriel, 2, to spend an afternoon at Karma Life Yoga&rsquo;s Laoximen studio to demonstrate a simple family practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Family Flower</strong><br />\r\nBe creative and find a way to make every member of the family connect in this blooming pose.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Swinging Basket</strong><br />\r\nHave your child come into this pose on the ground first then slowly lift up, placing hands on child&rsquo;s arms, and gently swing back and forth.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Totem Pole</strong><br />\r\nLine up the shortest to the tallest in a wide-legged stance with arms open wide.

Obviously they thought I would wholeheartedly agree. But I don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From a nutritional perspective, all cow&rsquo;s milk is basically the same for major nutrients; it is in the processing of milk that questions arise.&nbsp;To clarify, here are explanations of how milk is processed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>UHT:</strong> Ultra High Temperature. In the US the milk is heated up to 280 degrees Fahrenheit for 2 seconds. In Europe the milk is heated to 150 degrees Celsius for 5 seconds. This inactivates or kills all harmful microorganisms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pasteurization:</strong> Fresh milk is heated up to 70-75 degrees Celsius for 15 seconds. This process (as with UHT milk) removes all harmful bacteria such as salmonella, Brucella abortus, toxoplasmosis and a whole host of other critters that can cause intestinal distress or worse.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Microfiltration:</strong> During this process milk is passed through super sophisticated membranes that are able to remove greater than 99 percent of the harmful microorganisms. The remaining one percent is then heat treated to effectively remove the contaminants. This process, which is slowly being adopted by the food and beverage industry, appears to be able to produce a product that is safe, has a longer shelf life than fresh milk and, because very little heat is used, entails less alteration of the nutrients and flavor. Unfortunately&nbsp;microfiltered milk products are not yet available in Shanghai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>What happens to the nutrients in UHT and pasteurized milk?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The calcium, as well as other minerals such as magnesium and potassium in milk, are not altered by either process. Both types of milk are still excellent sources of calcium and magnesium needed for growing bones and teeth and healthy hearts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamins are a bit more fragile than minerals, especially the water-soluble vitamins such as vitamin C and the B vitamins (riboflavin, niacin and pyridoxine). These vitamins are affected by the heat treatment of both processes in equal amounts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The percentage of the decrease varies depending on the studies, so suffice to say there is less available due to these treatments. To be sure, vitamin C and the B vitamins are widely available in the food supply, so a bit less from milk is not an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What about protein?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Apparently the high temperature of the UHT process changes the shape of the milk protein, which is referred to as denatured, making it slightly less available. Protein appears unaffected during the pasteurization process because lower temperatures are used. The difference of protein availability is about eight percent. That is, UHT makes 92 percent of the protein available and pasteurization, 100 percent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>What should parents in Shanghai do when it comes to choosing milk?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always err on the side of safety and serve my family either organic pasteurized or organic UHT milk. Avoiding nasty bacteria and the other contaminants far outweighs any minor loss of nutritional content.&nbsp;I still think there is great nutritional value in a glass of organic or New Zealand UHT milk and I will continue to recommend that pregnant women and children drink UHT for a safe, reliable source of calcium.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Margaret Keefe is a registered dietician and founder of the Shanghai Nutrition Practice Group.&nbsp;</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>For more tips on eating well in Shanghai, check out the brand new edition of the Eat Well Shanghai Guidebook available at <a href=\"http://www.eatwellshanghai.com./\">www.eatwellshanghai.com.</a></em></p>'), ('1', '1', '31', '1', '<p><em>by Margaret Keefe</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Food safety is one of the top concerns of parents in Shanghai. What we feed our families is essential to children&rsquo;s growth and development, but when faced with frequent food safety scandals in China, it&rsquo;s hard not to feel overwhelmed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One way to take control of food safety is learning how to properly wash your fruits and vegetables. Try using these washing methods for all your produce - whether it&rsquo;s local, organic or imported - to help reduce your family&rsquo;s exposure to pesticides and bacteria found on food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Wash your hands with warm, soapy water before you do anything with food. Right there you have eliminated a whole bunch of germs before you have even started.<br />\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Divide your produce in to peeled and ready to eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>For peeled produce</strong><br />\r\nRinse the outside with filtered water and remove the peel, while taking care to keep cleaning your knife. Bacteria and pesticide residue on the outside of an item can make its way inside on your knife. When you are done peeling give the produce another rinse with the filtered water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Non-peeled produce</strong><br />\r\nRemove the outer leaves (ie. lettuce) and follow the next steps.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Fill a large pot with filtered water and add a few drops of produce cleanser. What is produce cleanser? A cleanser usually has something in it, such as an acid or essential oil like orange, that will remove any coating, particularly wax, which often traps pesticides and germs. Here are a few suggestions for cleansers:<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Create your own by mixing a half a cup of vinegar with 4 tablespoons of salt and 2 cups of water.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Buy a natural anti-bacterial produce cleanser. There is a variety available at grocers around town.<br />\r\n&bull;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Bring an organic produce cleanser from your home country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Rinse all your produce under running water for 30 seconds. This will remove a lot of the residues and dirt from produce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Soak in the filtered water/cleanser mix for no more than 5 minutes.<br />\r\n6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Drain and rinse under filtered water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '32', '1', '<p><strong>Ambassy Club</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Stunning facilities in a truly beautiful surrounding means that, although the membership may seem steep, Ambassy is actually great value for the money.&nbsp;// RMB6000/year, 1500 Huaihai Zhong Lu, by Wulumuqi Lu, 1500淮海中路，近乌木齐路 (64379800)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Alive Shanghai</strong><br />\r\nThis studio offers a variety of lively and energetic workouts such as Zumba, Boxfit and Bounce &ndash; a trampolining class - to keep you in the best of shape.&nbsp;// 1) 168 Shunchang Lu, by Zizhong Lu, 顺昌路168号， 近合肥路 2) 506 Huangpi Nan Lu, by Zizhong Lu 黄陂南路506号, 近合肥路(13917471154, <a href=\"http://alive-sh.com/\">alive-sh.com</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>California Fitness</strong><br />\r\nWith a variety of classes and personal training services on offer, California fitness is a great place to get pumped up. // 5/F Infiniti Plaze, 138 Huaihai Zhong Lu, by Pu&rsquo;an Lu, 淮海中路138号, 无限度广场, 近普安路 (4008100988, <a href=\"http://www.china.californiafitness.com/\">californiafitness.com/cn</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Golden Gloves</strong><br />\r\nThis gym trains expats for the now-notorious renowned Brawl on the Bund and boxing classes here will help you punch and pound your way into shape. // 16/F, 68 Xinqiao Lu, by Xinzha Lu 新桥路68号16楼, 近新闸路 , 51717517 (info@goldenglovesgym.com, <a href=\"http://whitecollarboxingchina.com/\">whitecollarboxingchina.com</a>)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Pure Yoga</strong><br />\r\nOpening in September, Pure Yoga is an all-encompassing world of yogic brilliance offering members 125 different classes in more than 20 different styles per week.

Glorious myriads of creepy crawlies, small mammals and reptiles make this an almost&nbsp; risk-free bet for children of all ages. The small but well stocked gift shop will prove particularly popular with fans of lizards and dinosaurs (admission: adults RMB 40, children RMB25).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Shanghai Zoo</strong> (2381 Hongqiao Rd) located on the former grounds of the old colonial golf course has retained a spacious, park-like feel. The zoo has a good collection of animals including monkeys, bears, lions, rhinos, giraffes, vultures and more. Incremental renovations have resulted in an eclectic atmosphere, with state-of-the-art facilities jostling up against shabbier ones but there is a big push to get the zoo ready for Expo 2010 so that the animals too can enjoy the benefits of &lsquo;Better city, better life&rsquo; (admission: RMB 40).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Further out is the <strong>Shanghai Wild Animal Park</strong> (178 Nanliu Rd), which hosts over 200 species including giraffes, zebras, antelopes and rhinoceroses, giant pandas, golden monkeys, South china tigers and Asian elephants. While hardly &lsquo;wild&rsquo;, the animals are in slightly less enclosed spaces than at the zoo. The park is divided into a walking zone (including a petting zoo) and a bus safari. The park also features various animal shows as well as other questionable attractions (though the park insists it has stopped the most notorious of these: the sacrifice of live chickens and ducks &ndash; for a fee - to the animals in the &lsquo;carnivore zone&rsquo; (admission: adults RMB 130, children RMB 65).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shanghai also has two quite lavish aquariums. The <strong>Shanghai Ocean Aquarium</strong> located at 1388 Lujiazui Ring Road, in the heart of Pudong New Area, is the slicker of the two. This state-of-the-art aquarium hosts a wide variety of underwater creatures, from sharks, rays and sea turtles to seals and penguins. Animals are organized by region and environment, many immersively viewed from within transparent tunnels &ndash; including the world&rsquo;s longest. For those in search of an eccentric birthday adventure, sleep over parties can be booked at the aquarium (admission: adults RMB 160, children RMB 110).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Changfeng Ocean World</strong> (Aquaria 21) located inside Changfeng Park (close to gate no. 4 at 451 Daduhe Rd) is another good place for fans of underwater life. Colorful Sea creatures are displayed according to theme. Kids will specially enjoy the slightly cheesy but atmospheric &lsquo;Inca temple&rsquo; and &lsquo;sunken pirate ship&rsquo;. The steep ticket price includes entrance to a live show, which is housed in a separate building on the other side of the lake. The show featuring dolphins, sea lions and lots of clowns is an extremely popular venue for school trips (admission: adults RMB 140, children RMB 90).</p>'), ('1', '1', '37', '1', '<p>One hundred pandas made from bamboo were put on display at Shanghai&#39;s Jing&#39;an Kerry Centre on Monday to raise public awareness of environmental protection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crafted by Danish artist Josh Yick, the troupe will stay there until June 8, when they&#39;ll be shipped off to another 31 cities across China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While 1,600 pandas live in the wild in China, by the end of 2013 there were only 376 captive-bred giant pandas around the world. 42 of the 49 panda cubs born last year survived, a record number for giant panda breeding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Image via Xinhua]</p>'), ('1', '1', '38', '1', '<p>Don&#39;t let your expat kids grow up in a financial bubble.

In fact, most times, basics items - along with recycled objects and a few specialty materials - are all one needs for successful art making.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Here are the top 12 essentials to unleash creativity at home:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Table covering</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you do not have a designated space to get crafty with the kids, the number one basic material you&rsquo;ll need is reusable, coated fabric. This should be large enough to allow children the freedom to get messy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Paper&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>White, colored, thick, thin, textured, printed, transparent, recycled. A wide array of papers will allow maximum creativity. Also, remember to save all cut-offs and salvaged papers to re-use for collages, mosaics, paper mache and the like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Age appropriate drawing materials &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For children under three, slightly larger crayons and markers are best. For older children, mediums with finer tips such as pencils and color pencils can be added to encourage finer dexterity. Watercolor pencils are especially great as they function as both pencils and watercolors, demanding a higher artistry command from your kid.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Paints&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Be sure to get non-staining, water-soluble or tempera paints for easy clean up and to avoid permanently staining clothes. Watercolor paints are a nice addition at any age.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Paint brushes&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Brushes are a staple and it is good to have a number of different sizes on hand. Alternative applicators for paints are fun and easy to find as well. Things like household sponges, bubble wrap and corrugated cardboard can all be cut to form new shapes and be used for stamping.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Scissors, compass, ruler</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These can be given to older children as they do feature sharp ends. A pair of scissors, a compass, and a ruler will open up endless possibilities and perhaps even stir your child&rsquo;s inner architect flair.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Glue (glue stick, paste, PVA) and tape &nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to regular transparent tape; colored electrical and duct tape from your household can also be fun for younger children to use as material other than adhesives.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Chalkboard, whiteboard or designated wall&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having a designated vertical space for arts and crafts is a nice way for children to let themselves go. It will also save your other walls from unwanted doodles. If at all possible, this should be a permanent fixture rather than something to be removed after use. Homemade solutions include turning a section of a wall into a chalkboard, tacking large sheets of paper up (place plastic sheeting underneath) or just designating one wall for decoration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Modeling or foam clay&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These clays are fast drying and lightweight. Having raw materials for children to fashion into symbolic or representational forms is crucial in enhancing their abstract thinking. For a DIY alternative, flour-salt-water dough tinted with watercolors or food dyes are also really easy to make.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. &nbsp;Foam paper</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is great for mosaics and soft sculptures. It is a relatively new, easy-to-cut material that comes in a wide range of colors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; Pipe cleaners, wire, string and yarn&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Make sure you have such materials to use as fasteners, beads and object stringers and hangers, as well as materials with which you can build.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>12.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Shiny bits&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nBeads, sequins, foil paper, buttons, and glitter (if you dare) are wonderful final touches to any project.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reduce, Reuse, Create!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recycled and up-cycled items are wonderful materials to use. They&rsquo;re inexpensive and make a great tool to teach children about the importance of being resourceful. Their uses are numerous and the lessons kids will learn from re-using and recycling are life-long.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try using bottles, egg cartons, plastic containers, toilet paper rolls and plastic utensils in projects.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Old t-shirts, household sponges, pieces of cardboard and the like can be fashioned into stamps for printmaking.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Magazines, recycled paper, and fabric remnants can also be transformed into materials for collages, decoupages, and paper mache. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take-out food containers and lids are perfect paint jars and palette boards.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rubber bands, buttons, pieces of string, twist-ties and cardboard boxes of all shapes and sizes can be the inspiration for something wonderful.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '50', '1', '<p><em>By Kimberly Pratt and Ellen Jin</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1.

As time passed, the tables turned. Back in 2001, the &lsquo;One City, Nine Towns&rsquo; project was set in place to decentralize the city by building nine satellite towns modeled after foreign cities. However, the plan seems to have fallen through and faded into the background.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thames Town was completed and open to the public in 2006. Originally planned to house 10,000 inhabitants, it&rsquo;s currently home to only a handful, and is sometimes called a ghost town, except for the newlywed Chinese couples being photographed in this quirky place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around an a hour from downtown Shanghai, once there you will be greeted by an overwhelming revelation of rural Shanghai-turned-facsimile of olden days of British-living. The town&rsquo;s architecture is comprised of an eclectic selection of Victorian, Georgian and Tudor. Lots of Tudor, in fact.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Amidst the two-story houses, the &lsquo;Christ Church of Bristol&rsquo; is eye-catching; the doors and windows are bolted, however, as are many local boutiques. It seems that a great majority of the town is mere decor.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of functionality, Thames Town still stands shockingly indistinguishable from suburban Britain. Luckily, right when you start to forget that you indeed are still in Shanghai, the image of Chinese brides posing with statues of Winston Churchill will jolt you right out of your English trance.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The Jaccaci family (featured on the previous page) is part of the &ldquo;handful&rdquo; of residents that make Thames Town home. Tony Jaccaci believes things are changing in Thames Town: &ldquo;Yes, it used to be a ghost town, but it is actually really picking up especially on the weekends and can be a fun place to visit.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With two hotels, the Liston and Finity, more restaurants, tea houses and shops, Jaccaci recommends a visit and shares some of his favorite things to do in Thames Town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What to do:&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thames town can be easily explored on foot or by bike. Three-person bikes are available for rent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pack a picnic and sit by the picturesque lake.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Visit the Thames Town Museum in the center of the Thames Town complex.

Students can benefit tremendously during the summer months from activities outside the classroom. Students of all ages digress two to three months in their academic skills during the summer if they do not have intellectual stimulation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research shows that students score lower on standardized tests at the end of summer vacation than they do on the same tests at the beginning of the summer. Learning loss is cumulative, summer after summer. It impacts post-secondary education and work force preparedness. High-quality summer learning is essential to preventing &ldquo;summer learning loss&rdquo; and encourages students to be lifelong learners, rather than only classroom learners.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few academically engaging hours scheduled daily can close learning gaps and help students perform at higher levels during the school year.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here are some tips to prevent summer learning loss:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>1. Work on Reading Comprehension and Grammar</strong><br />\r\nSet aside time for students to read one hour each day. Books should be challenging. Set a goal and tally the number of books on a calendar. Read an interesting series, but also classics, new fiction, poetry, and technical books to learn new ways to think. If the student is a teenager, ask them to consider reading difficult stories in international newspapers and magazines such as the New Yorker or The Economist.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents of children reading below grade level should read with their children in order to assist with sounding out words. Parents can also consider purchasing reading comprehension workbooks and grammar books, as students can benefit from self-quizzes that helps develop memory and inference skills. Review the past grade level&#39;s grammar concepts, and begin to work on the next school year&#39;s concepts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Improve Vocabulary&nbsp;</strong><br />\r\nAsk students to write down words they don&rsquo;t recognize in a notebook and look up the meaning later when they are reading. Students should also set a goal of learning a specific number of words and use it in their speech and writing. Students can also create flashcards of words, prefixes, and suffixes.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Develop Math Skills</strong><br />\r\nSet aside some time to review math concepts, practice computational skills, and improve problem-solving skills. Worksheets are useful, as are computer-based games, spatial games, and toys. Spatial skills predict achievement in the &quot;STEM&quot; fields - science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Parents can purchase a math workbook for their child&#39;s academic level.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Focus on Specific Skills or Subjects</strong><br />\r\nMany students take extra lessons in specific subjects or in the arts. Online resources and teacher supply stores offer a wide variety of learning materials to strengthen and improve their specific weaker areas. Students may find learning to be more fun as they become more capable of meeting challenges and overcoming any weaknesses. This boosts academic self-esteem.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Enroll in Camp or Travel</strong><br />\r\nGood summer camp programs with individualized instruction, parental involvement or small classes can allow students to discover an academic subject they are passionate about. Let students explore their curiosities -- paleontology, astronomy, rock collecting, the geology of Mars, the search for extraterrestrial life, or ancient history.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the family is vacationing, make sure the trip also has an educational component, whether the student is in charge of planning at least one aspect of the trip or asked to learn about the culture. Give them maps, brochures and guides, and see how they use their skills to figure out a plan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<em>// Dr. Liz Kwo has more than 12 years experience in higher education with degrees from Harvard Medical School, Harvard Business School and Stanford University.

This imaginative exhibit explores various interpretations of Da Vinci&rsquo;s famous work by local artists. And best of all, it&rsquo;s highly interactive with a Mona Lisa with interchangeable Shanghai background, a magnetic Mona Lisa to add various face shapes and a colorful room filled with contemporary takes on that well-known smile. Kids can even dress up in a Mona Lisa cape and wig. The exhibit has been extended until early July, better get there fast before it closes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>MOCA also hosts art workshops for children ages 8-12 on the weekend often in conjunction with ongoing exhibits. Two upcoming programs on Sunday, June 15 include &ldquo;Close to Mona Lisa,&rdquo; exploring Da Vinci&rsquo;s work from 11am-12pm and a session on shadow puppets from 2-4pm.

Upon entering the inaugural exhibition Myth/History, you&rsquo;ll be greeted by Maurizio Cattelan&rsquo;s Tree of Life.

The choir rose to fame when it performed as part of the hugely successful Riverdance stage show in the 1990s. More recently, the choir has featured as guests on three Grammy Award-winning albums with Sting, The Chieftains and Elvis Costello.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mr. Seaton was invited to audition to join Anuna on tour after being a fan and friend of McGlynn for several years. He explains, &ldquo;When I was teaching choir back in the States, I was Multicultural Music Chairman for the American Choral Directors Association and I was interested in sharing Celtic music. I looked into Riverdance and saw the singers. I bought their album and then did an interview with Michael McGlynn.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I decided to take a gamble and took some students on a tour to Dublin where we met Anuna and when they came to Seattle to perform we became pen friends.&rdquo; That friendship blossomed when Anuna toured Shanghai in 2012, with McGlynn even dedicating the song &ldquo;Danny Boy&rdquo; to Russell and his wife.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This month&rsquo;s seven-city tour will visit Changsha, Fushou, Kunming, Luizhou, Xuzhou and Hangzhou, reaching its climax with a special concert at Beijing&rsquo;s National Centre for the Performing Arts. He will be part of the choir made up of seven Irish, five Americans and one British singer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A group of BISS Pudong students will travel to Beijing to attend the final concert. While there, they will attend the dress rehearsal, go backstage to meet the performers, and get a taste of what being part of a professional choir is all about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While Mr. Seaton says he is a little nervous about performing, he is also thrilled to have the opportunity to sing with performers he admires professionally, saying, &ldquo;They&rsquo;re one of the ultimate professional choirs. Yes, I&rsquo;m nervous!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a regular performer&nbsp;with his band Laowai Hi-Fi, and on stage at school, he&#39;s sure to be right at home with Anuna.</p>'), ('1', '1', '57', '1', '<p>For the edgier side of the Shanghai contemporary art scene, you won&rsquo;t want to miss the Moganshan Lu area of the Putuo District.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Start at the far end of Moganshan Lu near Changua Lu and Suzhou creak and take a stroll past the colorful walls of graffiti.

These pesky bugs love Shanghai&rsquo;s heat and humidity and can make being outdoors miserable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We asked Dr. Lincoln Sakiara Miyasaka, a family medicine doctor at Shanghai United Family Hospital for advice on how to avoid becoming a mosquito magnet this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. What are the best ways to prevent mosquito bites in children?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wearing protective clothing such as long sleeve shirts and pants, closing windows and using air conditioning in hot environments and using a permethrin-treated mosquito net over a bed at night will greatly reduce mosquito bites.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Repellents that utilize 25-35 percent DEET as their active ingredient will also help. They should be applied every four-six hours, especially before going to sleep.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Which mosquito repellents are safest for children?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>DEET is safe for kids above 2 month of age and pregnant women, but care should be taken not to get it into the eyes or mouth. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Are any recommended brands sold here in Shanghai or should they be purchased abroad?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We recommend Deep Woods 25 percent mosquito repellents, available in Shanghai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Do you recommend the Japanese Encephalitis vaccine? When should it be given and what are the pros and cons of the vaccine?<br />\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />\r\nThe risk in Shanghai for the mosquito-born Japanese Encephalitis is very small. If you are visiting areas outside major cities in Southeast Asia and South Asia for an extended period of time, particularly in rural areas where there are rice paddies and or pigs, this vaccine is recommended.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can be given after 8 month of age. If given at 8 month, a second dose is given at 2 years of age. Side effects that can happen are pain, redness, swelling in the injection site and mild fever. It is contraindicated if you have fever, tuberculosis, epilepsy, allergy to the vaccine, are immune-compromised or pregnant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. If your child gets a bite, what is the best treatment for the itching and swelling that follows a bite?<br />\r\n<br />\r\nWash with soap and water and use ice or cold pack for cooling to reduce swelling. Topical hydrocortisone creams, gels and lotions can decrease pruritus (itchiness). If the symptoms are generalized, oral antihistamine like cetirizine or loratadine can be used. Severe case may need oral steroids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '60', '1', '<p>Are you ready for some fun in the sun? We have your guide to the city&rsquo;s best pools.

We give them bottled or filtered water, we make sure they wear a mask outside or have the air filters on inside, but when it comes to a swim at the pool, should we not be just as vigilant?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have taught swimming for many years in Australia and Shanghai and I know that parents are always interested in how they can make their visits to the pool as safe as possible. There are several ways you can increase safety around water:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Make sure your children are aware of the pool rules and what is and is not safe.<br />\r\n2. Keep watch around water.<br />\r\n3. Give your children swimming lessons from qualified instructors.<br />\r\n4. Know what to do if an accident does happen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Each pool is different so it is important to familiarize yourself with a new pool and to be aware of any potential hazards such as blind spots when supervising children. Also, be on the lookout for areas in the pool,] which may suddenly become deeper.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The current advice about supervision from the <a href=\"http://www.royallifesaving.com.au/\">Royal Life Saving Society in Australia</a> is that it is the parent&rsquo;s responsibility to watch their children, lifeguards are just there to save lives. At the age of four and under, the recommendation is to always have your child within an arm&rsquo;s reach.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Equally important, do not rely on inflatable toys as life preservers. They can deflate or children can slip through putting children at risk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition, swimming lessons will give your child the confidence and ability to enjoy the water, but also some awareness of the dangers involved. Lessons also teach skills, which may help them if they get into a tricky situation.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When enrolling your child in swimming lessons, always ask to see a teacher&rsquo;s qualification and check that it is up-to-date with CPR qualifications and either a working with children check or national police clearance. If your child is attending international school choose one with a strong, year round aquatics program. Having constant exposure to water will help children be comfortable and safe in a swimming pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, if an accident happens, know what to do. You may like to enroll in a CPR course, or better yet for aquatic situations, see if you can find a Bronze Medallion or American Red Cross water safety course available in your city.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you follow these simple steps then you and your children will be able to enjoy the water this summer no matter where you are.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Mr. Samuel Hunt is a P.E and swim instructor at <a href=\"http://www.britannicashanghai.com/\">Britannica International School, Shanghai.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '65', '1', '<p>Urban Family has two&nbsp;RMB200 vouchers for&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.elementfresh.com/DesktopModules/HT/english/News/index.aspx\">Element Fresh</a> to give away.

Jing An Dist. (Metro line 7, Jing An Temple station, Exit 6 &amp; 8)</p>'), ('1', '1', '82', '1', '<p>Many expat parents can find it difficult to understand and deal with the challenges of raising global-minded children. Not many people know there can be various psychological effects for children when&nbsp;growing up in a culture (or cultures) different to their birth country. &#39;Third Culture Kid&#39; or TCK has become a commonly used term to describe children raised overseas.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Social scientists, Drs. John and Ruth Hill Useem, came up with this term while studying&nbsp;Americans living overseas in India. The scientists noticed that the expats shared a third culture that was different from both their native and host culture. TCK researcher, Dr. David Pollock has defined the term as &quot;an individual who, having spent a significant part of the developmental years in a culture other than the parents&#39; culture(s), develops a sense of relationship to all of the cultures while not having full ownership in any&quot;. Dr. Pollock goes on to explain that factors from the different cultures are incorporated into life experience and a sense of belonging in relationship to others develops from similar experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>TCK&#39;s show several qualities, some beneficial and some maybe not. Below are a few that you, or your child, may be able to relate to:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. &#39;Survivors not thrivers&#39;: TCK&#39;s often spend their energy on trying to fit into the culture rather than fully participating in and taking a proactive role in it, because of the new place(s) and people.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Cultural chameleons: Being on the move constantly allows TCK&#39;s to learn to adjust their behaviors to fit different cultural surroundings. In some cases, linguistic aptitudes develop &ndash; definitely an advantage!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Uneven maturity: TCK&#39;s are usually more comfortable with kids older than themselves. However, many TCK&#39;s go through a delayed adolescence at age 22 or older, because the normal development of establishing themselves as individuals may have been short-circuited while growing up in a cross-cultural, highly mobile world.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Can-do-practicality: TCK&rsquo;s tend to be calmer when things don&#39;t go as planned and are able to form alternate plans to work around their obstacles. Think about it: they&#39;re less likely to be upset over a missed flight because they&#39;re so used to flight changes and jet-lag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Prejudiced (or unprejudiced): TCK&#39;s have lived among different ethnicities, cultivating a greater appreciation for equality and diversity so they tend to see people, not their race or culture. However, the opposite can also happen. They may develop an elitist attitude toward their host culture and people, especially if they lead a privileged lifestyle or if the adults around them express their negative opinions about the host culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Creating and releasing friendships: Because TCK&#39;s are constantly on the move, they tend to skip past the initial superficialities in developing new friendships and dive right into the deeper levels of bonding. However, some TCK&#39;s have suffered the loss of so many relationships due to relocation that they may have intimacy issues because of the inevitable loss that is assumed to follow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. &#39;Where is home?&#39;: TCK&rsquo;s struggle to developing a sense of belonging, commitment and attachment to a culture which in turn can create a deep feeling of disconnection from the world. Low self-esteem and confidence are other possible byproducts. For some TCK&#39;s, a lifelong nomadic urge takes hold, and they find it difficult to settle in one place, or job, or relationship.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Real and perceived arrogance: Having the ability to see things from multiple perspectives may not be as beneficial as it may seem. TCK&#39;s can be impatient and contemptuous of those who seemingly only see things from one perspective. They tend to feel as if they&#39;re much smarter and &#39;worldly&#39; than people from a single culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our rapidly growing world sees more and more people relocating to different parts. A great deal of research is still being conducted on &lsquo;Third Culture Kids&rsquo; because of the influence globalization has had on human behavior.

Months away from its 20th birthday, the show has been seen by over 12 million people in more than 330 cities across six continents.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Described by BBC as &ldquo;part theater, part dance, part rock concert and part construction site,&rdquo; Tap Dogs is a celebration of show creator Dein Perry&rsquo;s industrial hometown Newcastle, located a few hours north of Sydney.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;It revolves around a sort of building site and metal workshop ideal,&rdquo; explains longtime cast member and Dein&rsquo;s brother, Shelden. &ldquo;Dein was a metal machine operator who just happened to learn tap dancing when he was five.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The show follows six characters: the Foreman (Doug Mills), 2IC (Perry), Rat (James Doubtfire), Funky (Chase Rossiello), Enforcer (Richie Miller) and Kid (Nathan Hancock) on the job.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It opens with a solitary dancer performing on a small, red flat surface and builds into a spectacle over 80 uninterrupted minutes. Throughout, the cast tap dances in water, upside down and while jumping through scaffolding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We build the set as we&rsquo;re going along,&rdquo; Doubtfire adds. &ldquo;So not only do you have to tap dance, be in character and entertain the crowd, you also have to check everyone&rsquo;s stuff for safety.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tap Dogs&rsquo; aesthetics reflect the true story of its creation. The show&rsquo;s original cast members learned dance as children under local teacher Lee Griffiths, who Shelden praises for &ldquo;teaching us how to make tap music.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Faced with no opportunities to perform, Dein became an industry machinist at 17. A move to Sydney yielded a series of small roles before his big break, a recurring role on the popular Sydney production of 42nd Street.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After that show closed, Dein returned to Newcastle to connect with childhood friends, with a desire to build a contemporary dance show based on their experiences. A small government grant funded an early version called Tap Brothers, earning Dein an invitation to choreograph the West End musical Hot Shoe Shuffle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a raging success. Dein won his first Olivier Award for choreography, and was invited to create a show for the Sydney Theatre Company. He connected with designer/director Nigel Triffitt and composer Andrew Wilkie to create Tap Dogs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Premiering at the 1995 Sydney Theatre Festival, the show caused a stir. Similar reactions followed at the Edinburgh Festival, with subsequent tours across Australia and Europe, as well as residencies in the West End and off-Broadway in New York. Numerous awards followed, including a second Olivier Award for Dein. The 2000 film Bootmen immortalized the show&rsquo;s creation story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Throughout its run, the show keeps evolving, adding new props, tricks and things for the dancers to tap on. &ldquo;The tap is tighter, our technique is stronger, the lighting&rsquo;s gotten much bigger and we&rsquo;ve incorporated new technology into the show,&rdquo; says Shelden.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mills says the biggest change has been the characters&rsquo; growth. &ldquo;All of them were based on the original cast and, over time, we&rsquo;ve added a lot of gags,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;The show has gotten a lot funnier and the characters stronger. There&rsquo;s not a story to our show, but the characters create one. You start to like them for different reasons.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its Shanghai residency is a major feature of this year&rsquo;s Shanghai Tourism Festival. The QSW Culture Center plans to introduce tap dancing workshops, with the first ones set for August 31 concurrently at K11, Kerry Centre and Global Harbor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Boosting the art form&rsquo;s popularity is a welcome byproduct of the show&rsquo;s success. Dein has established the Tap Pups school to teach kids, and Shelden notes with pride how Tap Dogs has changed perceptions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The cool thing is kids are inspired to do it, because they see the cool rock &lsquo;n roll band style we do and that it is not too 42nd Street,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;They go, &lsquo;That&rsquo;s cool. If I were to tap dance, I want to do it like the Tap Dogs do.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Sep 2-21, 8pm (2pm matinees on weekends), RMB150-880. QSW Culture Center, 179 Yichang Lu, by Jiangning Lu 宜昌路179号, 近江宁路 (<a href=\"http://www.smartshanghai.com/smartticket/\">www.smartshanghai.com/smartticket</a>)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '84', '1', '<p>In Shanghai the process of selecting food is complicated by an abundance of horror stories; from bird flu infected chicken to hormone infused milk and vegetables steeped in pesticides. Although these stories are usually&nbsp;(fingers crossed)&nbsp;more heard than seen, they nevertheless make the decision on how and with what you feed your family that much more challenging. As pages of newspapers, magazines and the web are constantly occupied with food safety issues, it is important not to overlook the many online grocers and restaurants that have set their sights on combatting the &lsquo;unclean&rsquo; food label.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Starting off with tackling the pesticide problem, there is no shortage of organic options in Shanghai. Although there will always be the question of &lsquo;can I trust the organic certification?&rsquo; it is still relatively better to go with the organic option instead of eating non-organic produce. A recent scientific review conducted by Newcastle University revealed organic foods are higher in nutrients and lower in pesticides compared to conventionally grown varieties. Although ultimately the key to keeping yourself and your family healthy&nbsp;is eating more fruit and vegetables (whether they are organic or not),&nbsp;the study showed organic varieties contain higher levels of antioxidants, which are linked to health benefits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price wise it will be more expensive to venture down the organic road compared to going your nearest wet market. However&nbsp;if you&rsquo;re buying from expat catered grocery stores its definitely worth shopping&nbsp;around. Organic grocers like Green &amp; Safe and Fields do weekly deals on their fruits and vegetables, as well as other products. Don&rsquo;t get us wrong, buying fruit and veg from your local store is not a bad thing, oftentimes the offerings are fresh and delicious. Just make sure you wash them before eating and peel fruit such as peaches and nectarines. Pay special attention to leafy greens and lettuce, soaking them and changing the water until it is clear.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meat can be another concerning food group for families.&nbsp;If you&rsquo;re leaning more towards the safe bet and the idea of watching chickens and ducks being picked for slaughter in the wet markets unnerves you, all of the expat friendly grocers offer imported and organic products. Specifically, online <a href=\"http://www.fieldschina.com/en/index.html\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">grocery stores such as Fields</a>, which has now joined with <a href=\"http://www.elders.com.cn/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Elders the Australian meat importers</a> for their home delivery, provide their own organic produce as well as fresh imported meats. <a href=\"http://www.cityshop.com.cn/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Supermarkets such as City Shop</a> and <a href=\"http://www.carrefour.com.cn/\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Carrefour also offer imported and organic options</a> as well as local Chinese meats from reliable sources. <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/8026\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\">Green and Safe is a smaller grocer</a> but touts organic and clean produce selling their own organic meats including steak, sausages, burgers, chicken and fish out of the freezer in their Dongping Lu branch. Additionally all of these options also stock cured meats and ham.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve got allergies such as lactose intolerance or if you&rsquo;re just not into the different flavor that is Chinese milk, all the above mentioned grocers stock the usual soy and nut milk brands such as Alpro and Vita.</p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve touched base on how to fill your fridge, what if you want a night off from the kitchen and fancy a trip out?&nbsp;Personally we think eating out is fun and there are so many great restaurants in Shanghai that serve excellent food from all over the world. However, if you&rsquo;re heading out for a guaranteed detox worthy or vegan meal, restaurants <a href=\"http://www.pureandwhole.com/\">such as Pure and Whole</a>, Origin, <a href=\"http://www.sproutworks.com.cn/\">Sproutworks</a>, <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/8026\">Green and Safe&rsquo;s restaurant</a> and <a href=\"http://www.sproutlifestyle.com/cafe/\">Sprout Lifestyle Cafe</a> are delicious options that will leave you healthy&nbsp;and wanting more. <a href=\"http://www.sproutlifestyle.com/\">Sprout Lifestyle</a> also have an online shop retailing super foods and healthy food ingredients and put on educational cooking classes, workshops and health coaching.

In which case, kids need something quick to eat that&rsquo;s not too messy &ndash; and something that could also be a conversation starter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Foods that can be dipped or shared really open up children&rsquo;s minds to the communal aspect of food and might even help them make new friends. Both Chinese food and Spanish tapas are a great example of food cultures that embrace this idea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try packing cheese pretzel dippers &ndash; pretzel sticks and cheddar cheese cubes with Dijon mustard or another sauce as a dip.

It&rsquo;s both visually unappealing and nutritionally inefficient. Fruits and vegetables have a wide range of colors, so why not use the whole spectrum?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>How about a recipe that is colorful, creative and informative at the same time? For instance, an international-themed lunch idea is flag skewers&nbsp;&ndash; fruits, vegetables and cheese put on a stick to represent the colors of a country&rsquo;s flag.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or how about peanut butter banana slugs?&nbsp;The same classic ingredients of peanut butter, jelly, honey and bananas all wrapped up in a tortilla roll.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>A Special Diet or Allergies</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your child is on a special diet, low lactose or gluten-free for example, or if they&rsquo;re allergic to a certain type of food, sometimes packing a lunch is an absolute necessity. And although food options may be more limited, it doesn&rsquo;t mean the lunches you make can&rsquo;t still be creative.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a gluten-free diet, we recommend quick to make and mess-free quicksand ants.&nbsp;Celery sticks with peanut butter spread in the hollow and raisins stuck into the peanut butter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Adding a creative spin on lunches doesn&rsquo;t need to be time consuming or expensive. Simply making the lunches easier to eat, easier to share and more colorful is often all it takes to get kids interested.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And when kids are more interested in their food early on, they&rsquo;ll likely to be more interested in their food in the future.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Kirk Chu is a copywriter and content editor at FIELDS China (www.fieldschina.com), your finest online grocery store in China.

Emotional self-regulation, like walking, is a skill that takes time to learn.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For some of us, it is a lifetime endeavor. Yet we forget how hard it is and become so unsupportive when dark clouds loom over our children. If they can communicate their problems precisely and directly, we might be spared from meltdowns and temper tantrums.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active listening is a valuable communication skill that can help us to tune in to our children&rsquo;s needs and emotions. When they are fraught with a mix of feelings, or when they shutdown and refuse to communicate, active listening helps to peel back the confusion and get to the core of what is bothering them.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time, they will also gain more awareness of their own emotions and learn self-regulation. Tuning in to our children will also strengthen and deepen the parent-child relationship. Children who feel respectfully listened to will much more freely seek our advice and guidance, we can then build more influence as parents over time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Author Daniel J. Siegel explains the science behind active listening in his book The Whole-Brain Child. Siegel believes when our children are experiencing high emotional temperatures, their logical left-brain and emotional right-brain are disengaged. Children who get caught up in the moment let the emotional brain take over and their logical brain shut down making them unreasonable.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active listening is a way of communicating that promotes overall mental health in our children by exercising both sides of the brain, allowing integration to happen between the left and the right. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active Listening = Feedback of Fact + Feeling</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The message that is sent by your child is decoded into the information that he is trying to communicate (fact), as well as the non-verbal cues (feeling).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Siegel emphasizes the importance of appealing to the emotional brain, &ldquo;when a child is upset, logic often won&rsquo;t work until we have responded to the right brain&rsquo;s emotional needs.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeding back the two-part statement to your child will indicate that you have understood the situation and that you are empathetic towards his predicament.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- &nbsp;A boy is holding his broken toy airplane and is on the verge of tears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active listening response: &ldquo;You&rsquo;re sad (feelings) because your favorite toy airplane is broken (fact).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Your daughter comes home from school and declares that she is done with school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Active listening response: &ldquo;You are furious (feeling) because something happened at school that makes you not want go anymore (fact).&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The active listening process should be repeated and continued until your child has experienced an emotional release. When your child&rsquo;s emotional brain is unlocked, they will be more receptive to hear what you have to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Fine-Tuning Active Listening</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>- Your non-verbal language should reflect empathy; give full attention to your child, maintain eye contact and use appropriate voice inflection.<br />\r\n- Leave your presumptions out and focus on being a confidante - a safe place where your child is allowed to express all emotions without judgment.&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Take a step back and assess the overall situation, summarize the facts and feelings from time to time.&nbsp;<br />\r\n- Avoid roadblocks that will disrupt the train of thought - advising, offering solutions, probing, moralizing, reassuring - until your child has experienced an emotional release.<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Stella Antakusuma is a certified Parent Effectiveness Training (PET) Instructor.

You guessed it! Jet lag. If you, like me, are either arriving or re-arriving back to Shanghai after a summer visit back home you are probably living the dream just like I am right now (Only maybe with less banana rubbing.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not new to this whole jet lag with kids thing either, but I am new to the whole two kids with jet lag, husband has to work so he has to sleep and I have to suck it up and take them downstairs on my own. Bah! So with this I give you my tips on helping you and your kids to get over jet lag. The following is very scientific. And by that I mean not scientific at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Buy some melatonin supplements while you&rsquo;re back home. I thought this was literally the best idea ever thinking I was going to look jet lag in the face and be like: &ldquo;Ha! You thought you had me didn&#39;t you! Well take this!&rdquo;&nbsp;But it turns out that I forgot to read the label and it straight up says, &ldquo;Do not take while breastfeeding.&rdquo; Like, not even a &ldquo;not recommended, ask your doctor.&rdquo; kind of thing, just a straight do not take. I considered weaning Oren immediately, but (sigh) I guess I won&rsquo;t. If you are not breastfeeding like me then enjoy and know that I hate you. Instead, I currently have a glass of warm milk sitting beside me which I&rsquo;m too lazy/tired to drink. Gah, natural remedies for the lose!</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Keep the kids up until just a bit past their actual bedtime when they arrive back in Shanghai. This may mean that they&rsquo;ve been up for a solid 13 hours. In which case, load them with evenly spaced out sugar highs in anticipation of an eventual sugar crash leading to sweet, sweet sleep.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Or you could:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Let the kids fall asleep whenever and wherever in hopes that their bodies will naturally reset themselves. I&rsquo;m watching Oren who is sucking on a toy car and lying on the floor. So be it. It&rsquo;s not pointy and I have carpeting. That&rsquo;s good mothering right there.</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n	<p>Bring the kids into your bedroom, toss a few toys on the floor, close any doors tightly, snuggle up under the covers, and declare that they are allowed to have a no-holds-barred free-for-all on the floor while Mommy supervises from her pillow. Only wake up or commence supervision if you hear a loud bang or crying. Otherwise they&rsquo;ll be fine. (Not recommended for kids under age one&hellip;however, if they have older siblings, fair game.)</p>\r\n	</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Do all of these things and you&rsquo;re sure to be over jet lag in no time flat! Because dragging yourself around in this humidity while being exhausted is no fun at all! Also, you may want to try other things like just about anything you find on Google. I&rsquo;m not saying my methods don&rsquo;t work, but I am definitely saying my kids are still running around and its now 3:12am&hellip;so what do I know?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Niki</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Nicole Chia is Urban Family&#39;s new mom blogger.

Chengdu is home to a Panda Breeding Research Center where visitors can marvel at or take part in the ongoing quest for panda procreation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the wild, pandas are notoriously reclusive animals meaning sightings are rare.

Arrive early enough in the morning and you can watch these cuddly creatures at their most active: which means a lot of lounging around and having a feed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite efforts to protect them, pandas remain endangered due to a loss of habitat and a stumped libido. Intensive research programs have been developed in Chengdu to teach these habitually lazy bamboo-munchers all about the birds and the bees.

At Dulwich College Shanghai, there&#39;s also a breath of fresh air in the form of new Head of School, Damien Charnock. He arrived at the school last month after holding leadership positions in two of the UK&rsquo;s leading schools. Urban Family went to meet him at the school&#39;s Pudong campus to find out what&#39;s in store for the coming school year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s your first year in Shanghai after being in London for many years, what will the challenges be (if any) working here versus working in London?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Schools are very similar you know! They are fairly predictable, ordinary places; what makes them good is very un-mysterious. Managing a school here doesn&rsquo;t feel very different to managing a school elsewhere. There are more varied staff and children and you&rsquo;re obviously in a different context. There are two major languages being taught and spoken in school, rather than just one. But no, these don&rsquo;t present challenges of a very significant sort as long as there are the right structures to support them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When the opportunity came about to move here, was it something you had to think about long and hard?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was given the opportunity to think about it long and hard, so the process was quite a lengthy one, I didn&rsquo;t feel at all rushed in the process.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did you come out and see Shanghai first or had you been here before?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>No, I hadn&rsquo;t been here before so it was interesting. When I was invited to apply I knew I was going to get a week in Shanghai out of it, so that had advantages.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What&rsquo;s your staffing team like, is it a very good mix of Chinese, Europeans and Americans, what&rsquo;s the range like?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have a staff number of about 350 altogether. The school has a huge number of different operations and facilities, the grounds have got to be kept, the buildings have got to be a maintained, so there&rsquo;s a whole range of different people. Most of the teaching staff are from the expat community, mainly from the UK, but also from the US, Australia, one or two from Europe as well. Our Mandarin teaching team of course are Chinese, and Singaporean. It is a very diverse team.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>In comparison to Dulwich College London, do you think your schools are very similar, or do you have more freedom here to let the school brand grow in itself?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>They&rsquo;re not an attempt to be a clone, and you couldn&rsquo;t do that in any case. I mean Dulwich is an all boys&rsquo; school, which would be a fairly significant challenge here. It really is about the style and approach to education which we have in common, the &lsquo;Dulwich model&rsquo; if you like. The seven Dulwich schools in Asia are very similar in feel. You go to Dulwich Beijing and that feels very similar to Dulwich Shanghai or Dulwich Suzhou because they are in the same context. But we all feel quite different in many ways to the London school, but very much have the same approach to education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Dulwich Model is all about enabling young people to be confident and having the tools to go and express themselves, tell us more about that. </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It recognises that success comes from a very broad education, but an academic education is right at the heart, there&rsquo;s no doubt about it. A strong value is placed upon academic achievement and the schools are selective; that imparts a certain character to the school. But the Dulwich model very much is about recognising that the richness of the education experience comes from the whole of school life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For instance all the Junior and Senior school students will be going off in a couple of weeks to various parts of China. They learn skills of leadership and team- work, how to be resilient, accept challenges and how to cope with failures. The other side is a focus on creativity. Children are encouraged to engage in music, drama and art. The whole teaching at the school is focused on creative approaches to all things, including maths and science. Those are the key features of the Dulwich experience and that&rsquo;s certainly the same here as it would be in London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Dulwich in London is very synonymous with sports and excelling in all areas of sport, is it the same here?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes and Shanghai is probably among the Asian Dulwich schools, the most sporty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>I haven&rsquo;t seen the facilities yet, is air quality a challenge here? You have indoor facilities as well, so nothing has to stop if there is adverse weather?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing has to stop; we&rsquo;ve taken it on board and already have complete air filtration inside, so we are all breathing pure air. It was a huge investment, but it does mean in all our big gyms and so forth play can go on.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>That&rsquo;s very nice for parents to hear!</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well it&rsquo;s a serious business and putting the safety of children right at the forefront is obviously most important beyond academic work. We&rsquo;ve adapted well and have very advanced plans to develop an internal play-ground which will be pure filtered air, so we can play extensive sports inside when the air quality isn&rsquo;t great.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>So what are the highlights of the coming school year, we&rsquo;re expecting some drama productions&hellip;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October we have Diversity Month, something we do across the Asian colleges. Four concerts will be held here and we&rsquo;re bringing in leading jazz and musical performers from across the world. We have a few other interesting visitors coming, like the Queens&rsquo; College Choir and our own drama is on the way. Next term we have a massive music festival, engaging with International schools across Asia and thousands of performers including choirs and orchestras. We have an Olympiad, a new event this year in which 200 students from Dulwich London are coming out and touring the Asia schools in March. There is always something going on here, it&rsquo;s a very busy school.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You&rsquo;ve had a chance to talk to lots of parents before the start of the new school year, what&rsquo;s the feeling you get for family life here?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s obviously different, as our parent body is varied. I think here is a very easy area to live in and most families settle quickly. The school is good at building a sense of community so parents are much more involved in school life. One of the big differences between a school in the UK or the States is that you see far more of parents. They attend more events; the school is a social and cultural center..</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are more non-working parents than there would be in the West and so there are those kinds of differences, but that adds richness to the school and we have very strong parents association.</p>'), ('1', '1', '110', '1', '<p><em>By Sushmita Dekhne</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here are Urban Family&#39;s top tips for getting organised for traveling;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. Back it all up: It&rsquo;s a good idea to have scanned copies of all your important documents &ndash; passport, visas, itineraries, insurance card, hotel confirmations, etc. kept safely with you in case of emergency. You can also take photos of them on your phone to have them handy. Pro-tip: Send a copy to a trusted friend or family member just to be safe. If you&rsquo;re carrying a laptop, don&rsquo;t forget to back it up in case you misplace it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. Be gadget-savvy: Make the most of your gadgets by downloading helpful travel apps to make your trip less stressful. Do some research and download any apps that you might need during your trip. Apps for currency exchange (<a href=\"http://www.xe.com/\">xe.com</a>), translation, city guides, weather and flight/airport details (Flight+) are just a handful of the options out there. Pro-tip: If there is no in-flight entertainment, don&rsquo;t forget to download games, movies or e-books to keep the kids(and yourself) occupied during the flight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. Health is wealth: Make sure to check that you and your family have all the vaccinations required for your travel destination. Consult with your family doctor for all the various vaccinations according to destination and age. Pro-tip: Don&rsquo;t skimp on travel insurance! You never know all the expenses that you may have to deal with if anything goes wrong. Check that your policy covers travel and medical expenses for the activities you plan to do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Pack smart: Pack at least one complete outfit for each family member in your carry-on in case any luggage gets lost. Traveling, especially with children, can get messy so baby wipes are essential. Bring a travel detergent if you (or your children) are prone to getting dirty. Ziplock bags are a godsend &ndash; they come in so many sizes and have thousands of uses. You can use them to separate toiletries and avoid spills and leaks during travel. Don&rsquo;t forget your prescribed medication, contact lens solution or any other emergency drugs you may require. Pro-tip: Carry some children&rsquo;s Tylenol to avoid trips to the drugstore in a strange neighborhood.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Only a call away: Add all of your important contacts (travel agent, hotel, guides, travel insurance company etc.) into your phone before getting on that flight. Pro-tip: Save time by adding the correct country code so you can make a call ASAP.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Be on time: Keep the travel time to the airport in mind when traveling with family. It&rsquo;s always best to get to the airport early so you have enough time to deal with traffic, baggage check-in, toilet stops and any other unexpected problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Breeze through security check: Skip the hassle - stash away all your metallic jewelry and watches in your bag before going through the detector. Keep your zip-locked liquids (See Tip#4) ready for removal in an outer pocket of your bag. Teach your children to do the same, so you save time. Pro-tip: When traveling in countries that require you to take your shoes off, wear easy slip-on shoes. The last thing you want to do is struggle to tie your shoelaces while carrying your toddler!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8. Families with children first: Some airlines still have special boarding privileges for families with small children. Skip the long queues and take the opportunity to board first, so you can set up and relax in your seats with no rush.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>9. Fly wisely: Planning your flights well in advance will be sure to save you a lot of money and stress. The time of your flight can make a huge difference too. Some parents prefer night flights so the children can sleep, while others like to travel in the day because they have trouble sleeping aboard planes. Be sure to order kid-friendly meal options (if they have any) and keep food allergies in mind. Pro-tip: Check out <a href=\"http://www.seatguru.com/\">seatguru.com</a> ahead of time to look at the layout of the plane and pick the best seats possible. You can decide where you want to place your family &ndash; window, aisles or wherever works best!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>10. Ear-popping woes: Bring candies or chewing gum for your children (and yourself!) to suck on to relieve ear pressure. Breast-feeding babies during takeoff and landing or using pacifiers can make travel for babies a little more comfortable as well.</p>'), ('1', '1', '111', '1', '<p>Ever had one of those days?

Shanghai has so many exciting things to see, do and experience; we can&rsquo;t just let one bad day ruin it for us, right?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, that being said here is my quick guide to help you get over or through a very frustrating day in China:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; Find wine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; Drink wine</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; Repeat</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&rsquo;s about it.

If it&rsquo;s particularly sweaty feeling I&rsquo;ll reluctantly pull on a skirt - but my inner thighs will hate me for it. All. Day.

One day it&rsquo;s wet and damp, another day it&rsquo;s humid and sticky, another it&rsquo;s hot and sweaty, and another it&rsquo;s cold and sticky. Oftentimes it&rsquo;s all of those things in just one day alone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Seriously, make up your mind! So my dilemma each day is: how do I dress myself. I yearn for the easiness of getting dressed in a school uniform like my son Kai - it&rsquo;s polyester today&hellip; and every day! So I know what you&rsquo;re thinking - dress in layers! But no, that just means I have multiple things to sweat in or get stuck to various parts of my body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Last year in August I was nine months pregnant and absolutely suffering from the humidity. I went out with a friend to Yuyuan Gardens and the urge to pee was upon me. So you know when you&rsquo;re pregnant you basically have to pee right now, and my only option at the time was this little outdoor public toilet trailer that looked quite menacing.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friend looked at me like: &ldquo;Are you really going to do this?&rdquo; And I looked at her like: &ldquo;Dude, I have no choice!&rdquo; So five minutes pass, then ten minutes, and another five minutes. Finally I manage to get back outside and my friend just had to ask, &ldquo;Where were you?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My pants were stuck and I couldn&#39;t get them up.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took me 15 minutes to pull them back up with much grunting, heaving and a red face.

I didn&rsquo;t know whether to feel sorry for the little girl because just looking at her I was sweating, or to give her high fives to because under all that layering she must be getting the kind of spa-like weight loss treatment that the rest of us pay good money for!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Truly my favorite season in Shanghai is the one almost upon us &ndash; fall &ndash; where the mosquitos miraculously disappear and you can almost wear a sweater, almost.

Despite a late emergence onto the tourist scene, Myanmar offers a surprisingly stress-free travel experience: expect a warm welcome and to find English widely spoken. But do not expect to sit still long in this captivating country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fly into Yangon, the cosmopolitan capital city and global gateway to Myanmar. With astounding architecture, the city is any sightseer&rsquo;s seventh heaven, and the golden Shwedagon Pagoda, arguably the most magnificent of its features, cannot be missed (literally &ndash; it&rsquo;s huge!) After the spiritual sedation of Shwedagon, give into the kids&rsquo; restless inclinations by jolting yourself back into the city&rsquo;s hustle and bustle and losing yourself in the lively labyrinth of street-stalls downtown. When the city chaos catches up to you, soak up some sun on the Southern sands or cruise up the Irrawaddy River to Mandalay.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A plethora of pagodas abound the latter, highlights of which include the world&#39;s largest 87 ton bronze bell and the world&rsquo;s largest 700-marble-slab-long book. And this is but the tip of the iceberg; the most famous relics reside in the ancient city of Bagan, home to the largest and densest concentration of Buddhist temples, pagodas, stupas and ruins. This jaw-dropping site provides abundant photo opportunities and is the perfect playground for kids to take on a hide-and-seek tournament of epic proportions!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Explore the area by bike or ascend to the skies and balloon over Bagan for breathtaking aerial views. If this panorama isn&rsquo;t enough then Mount Popa, an extinct volcano, is only a short drive away. Finally, no trip could be complete without an excursion to Inle Lake. Here, fishermen will row you (with their legs!) past floating gardens, fruit farms and villages. And if that isn&rsquo;t bizarre enough then head to Nga Phe Kyaung Monastery for the &lsquo;jumping cats.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Classic Travel Package Myanmar Classic Tour:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;8 days/7 nights private tour package daily departure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Price from RMB15,780.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more details visit classictravel.net.cn or call 400 820 6113.</p>'), ('1', '1', '118', '1', '<p><em>By Sushmita Dhekne</em><br />\r\n<br />\r\nA trip to Nepal is great for adventurous families and a magnificent way to introduce kids to the Himalayan landscape.&nbsp;<br />\r\nScenic views from Nagarkot, a hilltop village near Kathmandu and internationally known for having the best mountain vistas, are sure to go down in family-trip history.

It&rsquo;s a time when people often find that they need support in ways they never did before, and it&rsquo;s also a time when they may find themselves completely without it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even after adjustments have been made, there are still all of the challenges that may come up as life, well, happens. It can be difficult to know where to turn during these times, making a free hotline service a vital resource for the international community of Shanghai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since the founding of confidential, anonymous helpline Lifeline Shanghai (LLS) ten years ago, this organization has made its goal the connection of Shanghai expat community members with help, information and resources when they need it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Lifeline&rsquo;s mission is to enhance the resilience and well-being within Shanghai&rsquo;s international community,&rdquo; says Coreene Horenko, the LLS outreach manager. &ldquo;We strive to provide focused support to our community each time the phone rings. It&rsquo;s a resource for everyone: adults, teenagers, and children.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Lifeline is a culmination of efforts from many people, the idea for which began in 2001,&rdquo; says Debi Yohn, a counseling psychologist in private practice in Shanghai who had an instrumental role in founding the line. She explains that the organization of the service was based on the model of the Tokyo English Language Line in Japan. The idea continued to evolve until the line came into operation in 2004.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Timothy Foggin, deputy medical director at International SOS, China, was also a fundamental part of its foundation. He describes how prior to the existence of Lifeline, there was a &ldquo;huge gap in care, with family doctors at the time seeing lots of individuals and couples going through incredibly stressful experiences. Marriages seemed to be falling apart, expat assignments were failing because of relational issues, and people had nowhere to turn.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lifeline Shanghai, in addition to expanded mental health services in Shanghai, has made it possible for both individuals and families to get connected with psychological support when they need it. The line is open to receive calls from 10am to 10pm and calls can be about any kind of topic from crisis support to information resources.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;At the heart of Lifeline Shanghai are our telephone volunteers,&rdquo; says Susan Hine, medical attach&eacute; for the US Consulate. Hine is another health professional who played a vital part in the foundation of LLS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Volunteers are screened carefully and receive thorough and ongoing training to develop effective listening skills and the ability to identify the appropriate resources for each caller. As required by Lifeline International, they are bound by a code of conduct and a code of ethics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This makes it possible for callers to feel assured that they will be able to reliably get what they need when calling the line, whether it&rsquo;s a listening ear or a referral to a therapist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;What Lifeline Shanghai means to me is a sense of community and connection among the volunteer team,&rdquo; says Allan McDean, LLS program manager. &ldquo;While the community may need us, we often need each other. Callers are also provided the possibility to discuss any topic in confidentiality and without judgment.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Horenko agrees, &ldquo;Lifeline provides a service to the community but is also a very rewarding place to volunteer!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This October, Lifeline will host a tenth anniversary celebration to celebrate the years of contribution to the international community of Shanghai. The event will be open to the public, date and time to be announced. Please check www.lifeline-shanghai.com for details later in the summer.

With my secret stash of rhinestones, buttons, felt, and trusty hot glue gun I can make a snazzy handbag to rival the ones you get at the fake market. Okay not really, but my birthday cards are awesome!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Back home I never really had time to flex my crafting skills and it was only during Christmas time that I found myself making really awesome projects. One year my husband and I thought we&rsquo;d skip the expensive presents and see if we could both keep under a $20 budget. Every year since then we&rsquo;ve tried to put more and more presents under the tree while still keeping to that budget. The fun competition means I got to craft, a lot. Everything from cufflinks to a very manly leather diaper satchel (which Ben firmly declared to look like a women&rsquo;s clutch and then conveniently &ldquo;lost&rdquo; it).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we moved to Shanghai (and before I discovered the greatness that is Taobao) half the things I really wanted I just couldn&#39;t find for a good price. And then, to make matters worse, I ran into the big problem of finding the things to make the things I wanted to make! It&rsquo;s like a vicious cycle. That&rsquo;s when my friend Sarah clued me into this magical place we call the arts and crafts market! Seriously there is a market for everything in this city. Its actual name is the Shanghai Culture Commercial Center. Yup, makes no sense.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located directly across from the Shanghai Foreign Language Bookstore on Fuzhou Lu, the arts and crafts market is ingeniously camouflaged as a stationary store. This is how they keep the riff raft out - you know, the ones who like to macram&eacute;. Up two flights of escalators and you&rsquo;ll find on the upper two floors a wonderland full of paint supplies, fancy paper, canvas, easels, glitter, play dough and much more!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a serious time suck for me since when I get in there I feel like Martha Stewart on speed thinking of a million different projects at once and wondering if I can fit a giant easel that I don&rsquo;t, BUT DO need into the car. The craft market works like every other market in Shanghai where you can bargain but don&rsquo;t expect them to budge a lot on price unless you&rsquo;re buying in major bulk; but everything is cheap anyway so whatever. Since discovering the craft market I&rsquo;ve made a bunch of stuff for the kids rooms including the mobile that hangs over Oren&rsquo;s bed, a mobile for Kai&rsquo;s room, Oren&rsquo;s Halloween costume last year and paintings that hang in both kids&rsquo; rooms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Between the craft market and Pinterest, I will rule the whole world with a glue gun and pipe cleaners as my weapons of choice! So, if you are struggling finding things here &ndash; my one challenge to you is to try to make it yourself! What Shanghai might lack in the perfect pieces of decor, it certainly has everything you need to DIY. Next, I&rsquo;m going to make a chaise. And by chaise I really mean sandwich. Cause I&rsquo;m hungry and a chaise seems wicked hard to do.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xo<br />\r\nNiki</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Nicole Chia is Urban Family&#39;s new mom blogger.

I like to call it &ldquo;mini Chinese New Year&rdquo; because it&rsquo;s the only other time of the year where everyone gets out of Shanghai en-masse leaving the streets relatively quiet. The only bonus over Chinese New Year itself is that it doesn&#39;t include a million days of fireworks! So. Many. Fireworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are any proper sort of expat you&rsquo;ll already have your bags packed to go somewhere fabulous - Bali, Thailand, Japan, Philippines, Vietnam! Unless you&rsquo;re like me &ndash; one of the few expats who thought it would be lovely to stay home for the holidays.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m convinced that traveling around during the busy seasons is not all it&rsquo;s cracked up to be. I mean, if I wanted to fight my way around crowds of tour groups, screaming kids, elbows to the boob by uncaring passerby&rsquo;s, and exorbitant prices, I&rsquo;d just spend the weekend at Yuyuan Gardens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is something about sticking around Shanghai during the holidays when everyone else returns to their hometowns that is crazy relaxing. The streets aren&rsquo;t as congested, you can actually get into a good restaurant without making a reservation days ahead (though you can&rsquo;t go cause you have your kids because ayi is gone - HA! Catch-22), and you can bike along the streets without fear that you will be hit by a taxi at any moment. Just kidding - you&rsquo;ll totally still get hit by a taxi&hellip;it&rsquo;s like they wait for you to turn the corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some of my tips on what to do during the oh-so-quiet holiday at home:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take advantage of the fact that no one is on the Internet and download as much as you possibly can! Work out your VPN until you just can&rsquo;t look at Facebook anymore and Skype everyone you know just because you can and you&rsquo;ll never have Internet speeds this good again.</li>\r\n	<li>Catch up on all of those fake DVD&rsquo;s you bought from the corner DVD cart but never watched. On my list: <em>Transformers: Age of Extinction</em> (I keep trying to watch this and keep falling asleep&hellip;so bad&hellip;it&rsquo;s just so bad&hellip;), <em>Godzilla</em>, <em>Jersey Boys</em> (when did this even come out in theatres??), and<em> Blended</em> (I love me some Sandler/Barrymore team-up!).</li>\r\n	<li>Make many freezer recipes. By this I mean take the left overs from meals that your ayi cooked for you and put them in the freezer so you can stretch them out for the week. You have to maintain the home for the whole week so you&rsquo;ve got to make sacrifices somewhere. And by &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; I mean pile up dishes, eventually needing to rely on take out containers to eat out of until ayi comes home.</li>\r\n	<li>Take the time to really explore your neighborhood. I live in Jinqiao and for about&nbsp; nine months I was convinced that it was only five blocks long and reached from Carrefour to Big Bamboo. Turns out Jinqiao is pretty darn big, includes a huge mall (that isn&#39;t the Kerry Centre) and has a bunch of different stores and yummy looking restaurants. I plan on taking a walk and looking longingly into windows that will be dark (because all those people aren&#39;t working) vowing that I&rsquo;ll be able to find it when they are open again&hellip;but knowing that I never ever will.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>So if you made the decision to stay in Shanghai for the holiday enjoy the city while its relatively quiet and you can avoid the big crowds! Except in Yuyuan. I&rsquo;m convinced it&rsquo;s perpetually busy there because people are stuck in some sort of time loop, which never allows them to go home. Seriously why is that place always so busy?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xo</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Niki</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Nicole Chia is Urban Family&#39;s mom blogger.

Every year on October 1, my uncle begins to work on the house. This includes dragging every nightmare inducing prop, toy, and decoration out of his second floor &ldquo;horror&rdquo; room to proudly display outside. And I don&rsquo;t just mean a ghost here and there, my uncle has full out animatronic people sitting in chairs getting electrocuted, alien butlers, and Chucky Dolls. So, I can easily say that Halloween has always been a pretty big deal in my family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every year between the age of 4-12 I was some version of a cat: black cat, tutu cat, cat from CATS, sexy cat, cat that grandma made to put on a coat because I was &ldquo;too sexy&rdquo; for being 12- years-old cat. There was also one year that I was Snow White which went over surprisingly well considering I&rsquo;m of half Trinidadian heritage and had caked myself in white powder for the night. Okay, I kinda looked like the Joker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming to Shanghai I figured that Halloween was one of those worldwide phenomena that people just participate in everywhere. Turns out Shanghai kind of&nbsp;doesn&rsquo;t. When I set to making Oren&rsquo;s Halloween costume (a Kurosuke from Totoro or Spirited Away), our ayi asked: &ldquo;What is that for?&rdquo; So I explained about Halloween and then she said, &ldquo;Oh! Yes. I know. But we don&rsquo;t do this.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was kind of disheartened &ndash; no Halloween? Seriously? Thankfully though being an expat means that there are many expats here that are missing the occasion as much as I am. And even if you can&rsquo;t walk downtown and see a million costumes like you can back home, many of the larger expat compounds as well as some malls like the Kerry Centre in Jinqiao keep the Halloween festivities alive. Last year the party just kept on coming and we ended up going to three different event&rsquo;s including collecting candy from the GAP and H&amp;M &ndash; random, I know. The only thing I truly miss is the lack of GOOD candy. Cause Halloween isn&rsquo;t a recognized &ldquo;thing&rdquo; you&rsquo;re kind of stuck giving out little bags of M&amp;M&rsquo;s or hawthorn candy instead of full sized chocolate bars and bags of chips. I&rsquo;m pretty sure hawthorn candy is the equivalent to getting those little boxes of raisins. I mean sure, you&rsquo;ll eat them&hellip;but you won&rsquo;t enjoy it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And thankfully there are options to buy Halloween costumes. Of course there is Taobao, but also there is the children&rsquo;s market and fake market where you&rsquo;re guaranteed to find a Spider-man or Cinderella costume in a pinch.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This year, Kai actually picked his own Halloween costume which means almost gone are the days when I can dress him in anything I please. Past awesomeness has been a hotdog and Totoro, this year it&rsquo;s a fireman. Oren I still get to choose what he&rsquo;s going to be and this year he&rsquo;ll be a crab &ndash; just so my husband and I can pass him around and say: &ldquo;We have crabs!

By the time the decision is made to begin lessons, wise parents (even if not musicians themselves) will impress upon their children that becoming a musician &ndash; even given very modest ambitions &ndash; is a life-long learning experience, which starts with a long series of baby steps.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes, it&rsquo;s difficult for a child to accept that the chosen instrument is not a toy (nor a fashion accessory), and instant gratification is not a realistic expectation. Soon the question appears &ndash; &ldquo;Can the music teacher carry the entire burden of keeping alive the student&rsquo;s interest in playing music, through all the hard work needed to develop the necessary skills?&rdquo; Well, sure, this happens occasionally, but realistically, one should assume the parents have important roles to play in the process. These are one veteran music tutor&rsquo;s ideas about what makes the successful music student tick, and how to prevent stalled ambitions from taking a toll on your child&rsquo;s self-esteem.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;He comes from a musical family.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no denying the advantages implied by this statement, but no one believes musical families are the only source of successful musicians. Parents who are musicians themselves will find many of these points self-evident; others probably less so.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Success enhances self-esteem, failure erodes it</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sounds so obvious, but I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of evidence that many parents don&rsquo;t see the risks involved in sending their kids to music lessons, without adequate support. It&rsquo;s common among children to identify quite strongly with the notion of becoming a &lsquo;cool&rsquo; musician, so if their accomplishments in music lessons aren&rsquo;t very impressive, anxiety might become serious.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ve all heard people say, &ldquo;I hated music lessons. My parents made me practice endlessly!&rdquo; Yet most accomplished musicians will give credit to their parents for providing the essential active encouragement that motivated them to establish an effective daily practice routine. Let us not diverge into the many, many reasons for it &ndash; trust me! DAILY practice (20 minutes is enough, at first) is the universal standard, since millions, no, billions! of musicians have proven it most effective, for hundreds, no, thousands of years. Shortcuts? That&rsquo;s why music tutors exist.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some parents actually try to avoid the most obvious self-esteem booster: the gift of an instrument. The giver, usually a parent, sends several important messages by means of this act of generosity:&nbsp; 1. I&rsquo;m willing to risk making this (just <em>possibly</em> expensive) purchase, because I believe in your ability to make it worthwhile, and 2. The instrument, the satisfaction of learning to play it, and also the responsibility to make good use of it, all belong to YOU. The resulting thrill should be redeemable for a promise to practice diligently! Those who inquire whether the school or tutor can provide a loaner instrument are longing for the good old days &ndash; it&rsquo;s not common practice anymore. Perhaps more important, they&rsquo;re taking a risk &ndash; that their child won&rsquo;t notice when some classmates&rsquo; parents have made this very appropriate gesture of good faith <em>before the lessons commence.</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It can&rsquo;t be denied &ndash; every music tutor has seen the sad looks on the faces of former students, who have given up in frustration. How could I have inspired them more effectively? we wonder. Yet it always seems reasonable to suspect that the individual was simply not adequately prepared to face the challenges of learning an instrument &ndash; going back to a time long before the tutor could have had any influence.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Exposure to performing musicians is essential</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A close view of a live performance is best &ndash; that&rsquo;s real inspiration! It&rsquo;s doubtful any age is too young to begin this process. Videos (TV or other) <em>focusing on musicians playing instruments</em> are also good. Listening to recordings without any picture is surely useful, but music-as-wallpaper alone really isn&rsquo;t enough to make it sink in, that musicians actually must possess skills in order to produce that fascinating sound.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Think about the images seen on video, which nowadays form a large part of the conceptions most kids have about music. Most pop music performances on TV feature only vocalists and dancers, and the details of playing the instruments are obscured from view. It&rsquo;s my belief that frequent exposure to this sadly impoverished representation of live performance is largely responsible for many kids&rsquo; inability to form effective goals, as beginning musicians.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Promotional photos and videos of popular musicians (especially rock bands!) are invariably designed to emphasize &ldquo;we&rsquo;re COOL. We never listen to teachers, parents, etc.&rdquo; That image is irresistible to the rebellious nature of kids, and all too often, they&rsquo;ll interpret it as license to be lazy about practicing their instruments. But the truth is, most of those bands play their instruments quite proficiently. They had to learn their skills SOMEWHERE, and practice them for some years, before they would ever have the opportunity to set foot in a professional recording studio, or on a concert stage. It doesn&rsquo;t happen overnight! Tutors constantly remind their students of this undeniable truth, but without reinforcement from parents (especially BEFORE lessons begin!), it often falls on deaf ears.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Developing fine motor skills requires frequent practice.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The weekly lesson is only long enough for the student to learn how and what to practice at home. Athletes and musicians are much alike in this regard &ndash; mastering the basic skills is impossible without lots and lots of repetition. The word is TRAINING. Success depends upon the ability to banish thoughts like, &ldquo;all this repetition is boring,&rdquo; and replacing them with, &ldquo;I played that piece so much better than I did yesterday!&rdquo; Again, a well-organized <em>daily</em> practice routine is the road every accomplished musician has followed. Without regular practice, muscle/neuron development (therefore advancement of performance skills) is typically much too slow, resulting in loss of interest. And if a classmate is practicing effectively, a comparison of their developing skills can be dramatic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Reading musical staff notation is an essential learning tool.</strong> (Parents of guitar/drums/bass students, especially &ndash; take note)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Traditional musical staff notation is no less useful to musicians than reading words is, to everyone. Learning the skill to proficiency usually requires considerable time and effort, but every other learning process goes so much more quickly after this hurdle is overcome, and doors open that would otherwise remain closed. Yes, there are many fine musicians who are &ldquo;illiterate,&rdquo; but it IS reasonable to assume that virtually all of them are especially gifted individuals.&nbsp; FAR more numerous are those would-be musicians whose ambitions stalled, simply because their ability to memorize everything was inadequate. Think of it this way: Musicians who cannot read must walk, but those who <em>can</em> read are able to drive, to get to the destination. &ldquo;Guitar culture&rdquo; wants you to believe reading is unnecessary, though few would make this claim, where other instruments are concerned. It makes no sense - don&rsquo;t believe it! Musicians who read well enjoy huge advantages over those who refuse to learn how, and &ndash; it can&rsquo;t be denied &ndash; they get more respect from their peers and teachers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you happen to live in a culture, a community, where everyone learns music without reading, fine. Then the student has a model for progressing with this method, and no double standards (see above) to make them feel isolated. Keep in mind that successfully learning to play &lsquo;by ear&rsquo; alone normally requires frequent interaction with other musicians, and most likely, much longer and more frequent learning sessions with teachers, mentors and/or others learning the same way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The truly exceptional student will learn, under ANY circumstances</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Occasionally, VERY occasionally, I get a new beginning student with exceptional abilities. His/her fine motor skills are already as precise as much more advanced students, instructions are understood and followed effortlessly, and they accomplish many basic skills in a few weeks&rsquo; time. Such students sometimes attempt to learn to play with little or no help from a teacher, and it&rsquo;s not uncommon for them to accomplish quite a lot by that method. However, there are always plenty of reasons to believe that having formal lessons, *in addition* to the self-teaching activity, would produce far better results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m amazed and delighted to see such talent, but I pause to think about how his/her classmates will view their own progress in music lessons, when the little genius&rsquo; prowess is displayed. I teach many classmates, in my international school practice, so I feel it&rsquo;s part of my job to promote the notion that students with average abilities are excellent candidates for the goal of becoming accomplished musicians.&nbsp; From a mature adult&rsquo;s point of view, it&rsquo;s of course &ndash; how could it be otherwise? But kids usually don&rsquo;t possess that degree of perspective, and so are easily discouraged, when comparing their own work with another&rsquo;s dazzling talent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, how about those children who don&rsquo;t quite qualify for the &ldquo;average&rdquo; category? It&rsquo;s common to discover that a certain student&rsquo;s fine motor skills are much less developed than those of other beginners &ndash; and this goes for students of all ages (other types of talent, or levels of intelligence, seem to have little correlation to level of dexterity). The hands just move more slowly, and less precisely. Here&rsquo;s my feeling about the matter (after 5+ years teaching dozens of students): As long the student finds the challenges involved in learning the instrument engaging, and hopefully enjoyable as well, it doesn&rsquo;t really matter if their accomplishments are very modest, and slower than others. For some, the ability to perform with steady rhythm may take years to develop, or even never come at all, but by no means should the effort be seen as a waste of time. Research into brain development in musicians makes it clear there are significant other-than-musical benefits to musical training &ndash; particularly if printed/written music is used &ndash; for example, in the area of right/left brain coordination.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, I&rsquo;ve covered the most prominent issues &ndash; the ones I deal with daily. How to conclude? Here it is: Patience &ndash; a goal-oriented process &ndash; is among the music student&rsquo;s most valuable assets. He/she should always be encouraged to take the lifelong view. Those who have experienced a lifetime of playing an instrument must certainly have set some goals along the way, and goals are best envisioned by examples set by others. So take your child to see a live performance this weekend!</p>'), ('1', '1', '136', '1', '<p>Students of the recently opened Wellington College put on a notable performance two nights in a row where the witty Jack and the Beanstalk was featured in the school&rsquo;s first Christmas Pantomime. 30 students between the age of seven and sixteen as well as some of the teachers were involved in the production and performance of the show. Director of Performing Arts at Wellington College Michael Larsen-Disney said about the experience:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I feel privileged to be able to work with some outstanding young people, within first rate facilities and supported by a school ethos that places real value on the arts. Coming from a background of being a professional director and performer in Theatre and Musical Theatre, it has always been a wonderful experience guiding young people to develop their art and interest in performance. The skills they develop along the way are transferred to everything they do in their lives and it&rsquo;s wonderful to watch them create and develop a story with talent, creativity, drive and determination.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Jack and the Beanstalk tells the story of a young boy living with his widowed mother and a milk cow that is their only source of income.

The peace and clarity she received from practicing yoga was what motivated her to come back to the mat again and again. Felicia sees yoga as a life-long process of learning and re-learning which ultimately leads us to our higher purpose of being.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nRichard Freeman and Joyce Ho are the two main teachers that have influenced her practice, her style of teaching and even her way of life. Richard has always been Felicia&#39;s idol for his beautiful and inspiring yoga practice. Joyce was her first Pilates teacher and has inspired Felicia to delve deeper into Fletcher Pilates, a physical transformation that leads from strength to balance to grace. As a mother of two, Felicia considers her children to be her best teachers in teaching her patience, curiosity and keeping a childlike heart.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nFelicia&#39;s classes are both fun and challenging. She uses a lot of humor to get her students to laugh more. Her teaching focuses on alignment and breathing, with the aim of cultivating a deep connection that facilitates movement from the core. She believes yoga is a powerful tool to clear emotional and energetic blockages, and to foster deeper levels of self-acceptance and compassion for others. Her teaching seeks to build physical and mental strength and help her students feel a sense of well-being and groundedness.</p>'), ('1', '1', '139', '1', '<p>If you know anything about me it&rsquo;s that I&rsquo;m an extremely social person. When I first moved to Shanghai I was really worried that I wouldn&#39;t find my &ldquo;niche&rdquo; of people I could call really good friends - at least not like what I have back home. And although my home friends can never be replaced, I&rsquo;m extremely fortunate to say that I&rsquo;ve managed to meet and befriend a large group of amazing women (and men) from all over the world that I&rsquo;ve gathered into a solid social circle!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But however good your vast amount of friendships can be there is something to be said about having a Shanghai Bestie. A Shanghai Bestie is one of those people you connect with on a whole other level beyond just friendship; whether it is the fact that not only do you get along well, but so do your kids AND husbands (SO HARD TO FIND), or whether you both really like a good glass of chardonnay together before 11am without judgement.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And often, meeting your Shanghai Bestie can be as simple as bumping into someone at Starbucks and both realizing that the barista gave you a cafe latte instead of a green tea latte (damn it Lily get my order right!) to stumbling upon one another at an infant playgroup both looking slightly haggard and like you haven&#39;t slept in 4 days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your Bestie understands you like no one else can in this city. They get the pressures, insecurities, and frustrations this kind of life can bring. They also commiserate with your first-world problems that your home friends just don&#39;t understand like when you could only get that garden-view villa in Thailand instead of the beach-view one - I know right!?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Shanghai Bestie Janet and I met online like any modern couple does these days. Initially connecting because we come from the same home town, we soon discovered that we also grew up in the same area. After being in Shanghai for 6 months, it was good to have a little connection to home and being able to say things like &ldquo;the Danforth&rdquo; and have someone know exactly what you&rsquo;re talking about. We try with busy schedules including kids, work, and exercise (that last one may be a lie), to see as much of each other as we can always knowing that even though life keeps us running we&rsquo;re only a text message away. And when we go on holidays the &ldquo;NO I&rsquo;LL MISS YOU MORE!!&rdquo; are always a given.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So, if you&rsquo;re still searching for that one true bestie to latch onto but haven&rsquo;t found them yet - here are some tips:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Put yourself out there. Write a post on a forum looking for someone with similar interests. Like to craft? Like to cook? Like to eat? Like all three things? Cause if you do, you and I can also be friends.</li>\r\n	<li>Make an effort to have a deeper friendship. In such a transient society it&rsquo;s really easy to not get too invested in a friendship because you know that other person could be gone at any moment. Instead, invite someone you really like out for a coffee or lunch and get to know them a little better than you would just passing by at school pickup. Even a brief Shanghai Bestie is better than no bestie at all!</li>\r\n	<li>Lie in wait like a tiger in the night. Hey, sometime&rsquo;s just letting your Shanghai Bestie find you is the way to do it. It&rsquo;s destiny after all!</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&hellip;I didn&#39;t expect that to sound so much like dating.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '140', '1', '<p>The BISS Pudong Auditorium was rocking on Monday 13th January as indigenous Australian musician Scott Darlow entertained the students with his unique blend of didgeridoo and guitar.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The &ldquo;didge&rdquo; is a traditional instrument made from the trunk of a small tree which requires the special skill of circular breathing to master. The atmosphere was electric with students marveling at Scott&rsquo;s ability to sing, play the guitar and add in the didgeridoo! It was during his childhood, visiting cousins in his family&rsquo;s traditional land, YortaYorta in Murray River country that he learned this skill; although he is quick to say, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m too shy to play with my cousins. They&rsquo;re so much better than me!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Scott is a Spokesperson for World Vision&rsquo;s Indigenous Programme, and used his performance to deliver an important message about indigenous people and reconciliation. He explains, &ldquo;Music is a vehicle I use to inspire people to be agents for change for indigenous people.&rdquo; A former international school student, Scott spent his early years in Hong Kong before returning to Australia to complete his high school education. As a former teacher as well, education is a big focus. He continues with a shocking statistic, &ldquo;Only 3.5 percent of indigenous Australians even finish school.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Together with his band, he introduced the students to his own compositions, as well as some important Australian indigenous songs, including &lsquo;Solid Rock&rsquo;, a 1980&rsquo;s hit which became an indigenous land rights anthem. The message he left the students with is FLUTE &ndash; Forgiveness, Love, Understanding, Tolerance and Empathy. He says, &ldquo;I say to the kids, you can be a history maker if you do 10 percent of each of those things.&rdquo;</p>'), ('1', '1', '141', '1', '<p>I remember back in the day when I&rsquo;d watch TV shows and the buzz word of the moment was &ldquo;soccer mom&rdquo;. You know that mom that would drive around everywhere in their SUV&rsquo;s taking one kid to soccer and the other to ballet, then she would bake cookies and attend a PTA meeting while bouncing the youngest on the hip. I was always like: HA! That will never be me!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I dropped Kai off to school then ran to a friend&rsquo;s house to make 1000 pieces of fudge for the upcoming food fair. Then, I ran back home, bounced Oren for a few minutes on one hip while I wrote an email one-handed summarizing the latest food fair budget I have for our group. Then, I ran back to Kai&rsquo;s school to give a (rather rousing) presentation all about Canada where I made all 16 kids wear beaver tails that I expertly crafted the night before.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I received a text in the evening asking how my &ldquo;soccer mom day&rdquo; went I was all like: HA! Not me&hellip;wait&hellip;.waaaaait.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yep. I&rsquo;m that mom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The funny thing is I don&#39;t even remember how I got roped in! The one thing I&rsquo;ve noticed at international schools here is that it&rsquo;s so easy to get dragged into the community - even if you&rsquo;re kicking and screaming, trying your hardest to resist. The school becomes so much of your life that you just can&rsquo;t help but be involved. And it often starts out small: a morning welcome coffee, a play date, chatting with moms in the park, and then all of a sudden BAM you&rsquo;re coordinating the winter pageant and stressing over how many pairs of wings you need for the snow angels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Suddenly I realize that I&rsquo;m on 3 different committees as well as class representative! Getting involved at your child&rsquo;s school is like getting a tattoo - once you get one you just keep getting another and another until you don&#39;t even remember that first one so you get another and another and then all of a sudden you have 5 butterfly tattoos in various places that you weren&#39;t even sure was a good idea the first time! Now replace butterfly tattoos with bake sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, being involved in Kai&rsquo;s school has allowed me to become part of a community you just don&#39;t get to witness from the outside. Being part of an amazing, well-meaning group of women, often way more experienced in the city than you are is a really great thing! Not only does this group of women care deeply for their kids&rsquo; education but also for the international school&rsquo;s community as a whole and you really start to understand how much they&rsquo;re relied upon to enrich the school&rsquo;s environment with various events each term.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So sure, I&rsquo;m a soccer mom and I&rsquo;m not gonna hate the term, I&rsquo;m gonna embrace it! Someone get me some kind of sash because I wanna wear it around proudly. Just don&rsquo;t ask me to make 1000 pieces of fudge again. Because although I smelled awesome, I just know the kids are gonna grab it at the food fair, stuff it in their face, and run away ungratefully. *sigh*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '142', '1', '<div>China&rsquo;s greatest basketball player continues to contribute to the sport&rsquo;s development with his program designed for kids.

Wait&hellip;let me rephrase that: I LOVED my hair. That is before the ravages related to pregnancy hormones and Shanghai water took their toll. I&rsquo;ve always had really curly and full hair; hair that makes most people go: &ldquo;OMIGOD I luuuuurve your curls!&rdquo; and &ldquo;Is that real?&rdquo; *touch touch* - always my favorite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s be honest, I don&rsquo;t let just anyone touch my hair. In fact, I was willing to wait a full year until I returned home to get my hair done again. A. Full. Year. Which is crazy, right? I mean, I have two boys which directly correlate to the amount of grey that pops up on&nbsp;my crown every day. Plus, I had the grand idea to get an ombre colour when I was in Canada, which turned out to be light at the top, brown in the middle, and light again at the bottom (I learned today this technique is called balayage - only mine wasn&rsquo;t any kind of good). Although the technique is&nbsp;supposed to create highlights that give you a &ldquo;sun-kissed&rdquo; look, it gave me what I like to call the &ldquo;Why the hell did I pay for this?!&rdquo; look. Once my original color started to grow out I was not happy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then my friend asked me why I didn&#39;t go to a salon. I&rsquo;ll tell you why - I need a black hair salon. It&rsquo;s a very specific requirement and I&rsquo;m simply terrified to go to anywhere else. Why you ask? Well, besides my own specific fears, local salons are terrified of me as well. In fact in other beauty related news, I went to the Sephora brow bar once for a much needed eyebrow overhaul and the &ldquo;aesthetician&rdquo; there almost refused to clean up my eyebrows because they were &ldquo;too different&rdquo;. My eyebrows. They&rsquo;re not even curly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After seeing my hair up in a bun for probably the 20th time in a row my friend referred me to her salon - a black hair salon&hellip;in Shanghai!

Granted I had it in my head that a good salon for people with hair like mine was nowhere to be found but I was pleasantly proven wrong. After fixing up my colour and cut I felt like a brand new person. India, my amazing stylist and colorist who does all textures of hair, performed a flawless consultation (I know this because I watched &quot;Tabitha Takes Over&quot; like religion) and then went to work. 3.5 hours later - yes my hair was a mess - I emerged like a beautiful butterfly from its dead cocoon husk! After paying (and shedding a single tear, but the price was well warranted), I was outside in true Shanghai fashion taking selfies! If you have afro or biracial textured hair I highly recommend them!

Depending on how you view it, it can be a place of foodie bliss or your understanding of what hell would be like.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I personally love the wet market. I was first introduced to it by a friend after lamenting to her about having to listen to that Gong Xi Gong Xi Chinese New Year song they play over and over and OVER in Carrefour and also how my tomatoes go squishy pretty much on the ride home in the car. She asked me why I had never gone to the wet market yet for produce and I just remember thinking: wet...market? Sounds...wet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So she took me to the one she usually goes to and showed me how to haggle over the price of carrots and most importantly what NOT to buy in the wet market. This is what I learned:</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anything that looks like beef - it probably isn&#39;t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anything that looks like lamb - it definitely isn&#39;t</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anything that makes you go &ldquo;WHY IS THAT SLIMY!?&rdquo; - it&rsquo;s slimy for a reason and that reason isn&rsquo;t good</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anything that looks too good to be true - it probably is (extra perfect strawberries is a good example)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Any sort of fish that you don&rsquo;t know anything about - if you don&#39;t know exactly what fish that is then don&#39;t buy it cause it was probably fished out of the river. Go to the fish market instead.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Anything that is alive and clucking at you - just be smart and buy your chicken frozen at Metro.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, have you ever SEEN a chicken killed at a wet market? Full disclosure - I totally bought one once with my son Kai there. He even picked the chicken out and my Ayi squeezed its little feathery breast before the very nice chicken lady threw the whole live chicken directly into a boiling vat of water so its feathers would fall off. Little brand new naive me thought they were gonna at least chop its head off quick and dirty first, but nope! Kai just kinda looked on in a wee bit of horror but thankfully hasn&#39;t retained that memory. Poor chicken.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, you may be wondering why they call the wet market a wet market. Well, when I was about 6 months pregnant with Oren I found out. The fruits and veggies are often sprayed down in the early morning or evenings to keep them fresher so it&rsquo;s not uncommon to have puddles or general wet spots around the market; wet market. So I was walking along, all cute and pregnant, holding my shopping bags full of mushrooms, carrots, and baby tomatoes that I was obsessed with; turned the corner and slipped in a giant puddle right on my butt. Yep&hellip;my butt was on the wet market floor somewhere between the fish corner and the meat aisle. To say that I was horrified was an understatement. Also never wear flip flops to a wet market - that was another unpleasant experience&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yet, honestly, the wet market is the perfect place to get loads of fresh produce for an awesome price. I&rsquo;m talking about a fraction of the price of Cityshop or Times and definitely Carrefour. Depending on your comfort level with what you&rsquo;re buying you can walk out with loads of stuff all while getting a chance to practice your Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Know your prices and what a &ldquo;jīn&rdquo; is before you go in! It&rsquo;s a half kilo if you didn&#39;t know. With your walking foreigner face and misunderstanding between li&ugrave; (6) and jiǔ (9), the experience can cost you more than what you thought. So thats why I send Lily - I&rsquo;m not ashamed! The shopping is done that much faster and I get literally DOUBLE the amount of groceries that I would get going in there for the same price! However, if you don&#39;t have your own Lily it&rsquo;s all about building relationships. Find a seller that you like and keep going back to them. That relationship alone is bound to get you some free cilantro and garlic! DO IT FOR THE GARLIC!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve never been to your local wet market go check it out. Even if you don&rsquo;t buy anything at least do it for the experience! And while you&rsquo;re there, try to solve a mystery that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense to me: why is it that the fish lady is the one selling the bean sprouts?

A centre of trade and industry, Shanghai has the most diverse architecture in China and influences from dozens of cultures. As you explore theatre in this legendary city, as you meet</p>\r\n\r\n<p>the people who call Shanghai home, ask yourself how the rituals of performance have added to the heady mix of life and the passions of past millennia. As storytellers, theatre professionals tell us the story of Shanghai, and it is a tale told from the many perspectives of the millions who live and work and play and perform - side by side by side.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Kline, Director of WISS</p>'), ('1', '1', '150', '1', '<p>Valentine&rsquo;s Day is around the corner and that can evoke a whole range of emotions depending on your love- and family situation. And if you&rsquo;re lucky enough to have met that special someone, it&rsquo;s still not obvious that you are excited about February 14, and in that case, it may have something to do with you being an exhausted parent. But don&rsquo;t let your children ruin your chances of romance this year!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Perhaps your idea of a perfect evening involves falling asleep on the couch in front of the TV with a bucket of ice cream on your lap, and perhaps you think that true love is about giving your partner what he or she needs (a good night&rsquo;s sleep for example), but don&rsquo;t forget that you both deserve something special once in a while. Whatever this &ldquo;something special&rdquo; may be is completely up to you, however. A romantic gesture doesn&rsquo;t have to involve a bouquet of roses, champagne and a fancy dinner. It may be an old and worn-out expression, but for a good reason, because &ldquo;it&rsquo;s the thought that counts&rdquo; definitely has a heavy meaning; especially when time and energy is limited.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being romantic is all about doing what you like to do as a couple while adding that extra touch. Do you love watching movies? Make sure this time to do it together, without kids, with a bunch of candles, a bottle of wine and your favorite snack. Do you like to have dinner together, but have no time to cook and no energy to go to a restaurant? Then order a home delivered meal from your favorite place and play some romantic music in the background. Or take a bath together with candles and champagne. The point is, having a special Valentine&rsquo;s Day doesn&rsquo;t have to be stressful, expensive or time consuming, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to be like any other mediocre day either. It is just as important (if not more) to show some love and appreciation once you have kids together as it was on your first Valentine&rsquo;s Days as a couple. The difference is that it&rsquo;s almost impossible to set the same standards for your date nights as parents compared to back in the day when it used to be only about the two of you. So take the time to do something together, and remember that even the smallest gesture counts.</p>'), ('1', '1', '151', '1', '<p>Celebrate the Chinese New Year in a traditional way, by adding ingredients that bring luck.

We were told it could cause ADD, it could make them obese and that it would slow their vocabulary learning, only to mention a few of the downfalls. But in a groundbreaking new study by Emory University in Atlanta, GA, it was found that infants can in fact benefit from watching some types of videos, in this case sign language learning videos, from the age of 15 months.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study involved a group of infants that were divided into four groups; the first one being placed in a lab learning sign language by watching a video, the second watching the same video at home, the third watching it at home with their parents and the final group spending 15 minutes a day learning by being instructed by the parents, without any video at hand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This may come as a shocking piece of information for parents who have taken great care to prevent technology use with their young ones, but as it turns out, the fourth group that learned the signs through parents did not have a higher performance level than the video-watching babies. The number of signs learned (out of 18 possible) was about the same for all groups, which came as a big surprise since it was expected that learning would be easier with a human teacher as opposed to watching a video.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The study also looked at the ability to retain the knowledge during a few weeks, which is generally challenging with infants. Interestingly enough, the first group who watched videos alone, without the company of parents, was able to produce more signs than the other groups after weeks had passed by, except for the fourth group where they were instructed by parents. It was expected from the beginning that the fourth group would do better than the others, but the fact that learning and retaining knowledge is easier for an infant that is placed in front of a screen alone as opposed to in the company of parents was a big surprise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The results of this study are in many ways groundbreaking, but there is still a lot more work to do. There is not enough research to prove that the conditions had a direct correlation with the results, and there is no information about any long term effects. It can also be added that working with babies is not an easy task if you are looking for a scientifically accurate conclusion since there is no way for the researchers to communicate with the subjects. Only 15 minutes per day was the amount of time spent watching videos, and parents should keep in mind that moderation is important as well as choice of content.</p>'), ('1', '1', '153', '1', '<p style=\"margin-left:0cm; margin-right:0cm\"><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Celebrate your love on Valentine&#39;s Day and spend&nbsp;some quality time together at one of Shanghai&#39;s best hotels.

Here are her thoughts on two passions of hers; photography and travel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did you become interested in Photography?&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My family started traveling around the world when I was 7 months old, which was the first time that I was on a plane. Whenever I saw interesting or beautiful views, I wanted to record them for some kind of collection. Also, another reason was my dad. He is crazy about photography, so he bought me my first camera when I was six years old. From that point, I started viewing the world as a photographer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What inspired you to take this trip to the North and South Pole? Who went with you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The South Pole is a mysterious place that I think everyone yearns to go to. On the trip to Africa, I met a Taiwanese that had traveled to Antarctica before, and he told me about a lot of fantastic experiences he had had there. I had traveled to more than 40 countries and to the other six continents before I went to Antarctica, so there was a motivation of reaching the seventh continent to have a nice ending before getting busy on college applications. So I made a decision that I must experience this exciting continent. I went to both Antarctica and the North Pole with my family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us a little bit about the trip, how long was it and when did you go?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a 9 days trip to the South Pole and 13 days trip to the North Pole. Since the poles are too cold during winter, they are only available for tourism during summer. So I went to Antarctica during the Chinese winter and to the North Pole during the summer, since they have opposite seasons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you tell us about the Camera feature/accessories you took along with you in order to capture the amazing photos?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have my common used camera and lens, which is <strong>Canon 6D</strong> with <strong>Ultrasonic 28-300mm</strong> lens. However, if I am traveling to places like Africa or the Poles, I bring <strong>Ultrasonic 200-400mm &amp; 600m lens + Extender 2x</strong>, because there is a safety distance rule stating that humans have to keep the distance between themselves and animals (South Pole, 5 m between small animals like penguins, and 20 m between big animals like whales or seals). So bringing big range zoom-in lenses is useful. For shooting landscape, I use <strong>Ultrasonic 24-70mm &amp; 16-35mm </strong>lenses<strong>.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Did you encounter any difficulties during the trip?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not really, the tourism part of the North and South Pole are already fully developed, and everything is well arranged for travelers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What was your most memorable part of the trip?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the strong messages that I learned from both trips is that we have to protect the environment and protect the animals! The habitat of penguins and polar bears are getting smaller and smaller due to some direct and indirect influences of the global warming.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>From the trip to Antarctica, the most memorable moment was when I was sitting on a rock and all of a sudden, two penguins came closer and started to run around me. One of the penguins bumped into me by accident. I was totally freaked out! They must have thought I was a part of rock or something. I&rsquo;m always really impressed by the relationship between animals and humans in the wild. From the trip to the North Pole, a moment to remember was definitely when we hit 90&ordm; N.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Now a gallery opening, how did this come about and who organized it?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been to Africa twice, and it&rsquo;s a special place on the list of places I have been. I have so many memories from the trip to Africa. The photos I shot there are not like the photos that one would shoot in &ldquo;regular&rdquo; tourist attractions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There were a lot of people asking me about my trip to Africa, and they were also interested in the photos I had taken there. I wanted to share them all since I only have one year left living in Shanghai. I also wanted to have an opportunity to meet my friends from my old school before I go to college outside of Shanghai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My dad has attended many different exhibitions for his business, so he is very familiar with it. He managed the setup of my exhibition, and I was focusing on the design of the invitations, the logo, sign board and many other things.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any one person who has inspired/encouraged your passion?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, certainly, her name is Chenman (陈漫) and she is a fashion photographer.

I work way too much and quite frankly, I don&rsquo;t have time to make friends in Shanghai (I am not one of those people who exclaim, &ldquo;you make time for what you wanna make time for!&quot;&nbsp;No, really...&nbsp;I have NO time.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Yet, I know my husband and I need some social interaction with other expats, so I recently embarked on joining lots of Expat sites (mainly on Facebook, because that is still my one addiction I&rsquo;d rather not give up yet.&nbsp;That and a nice glass of Chardonnay).&nbsp; My husband and I started chatting with another couple from the USA like us. Children like us. She, a &ldquo;high power business woman of sorts&rdquo;, like me. Him, a stay-at-home-dad&nbsp;like my husband.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">We &ldquo;courted&rdquo; each other quite a while on the phone and on WeChat, asked all the questions one does when looking for a &ldquo;date&rdquo;. Questions like, &ldquo;what do you love about living in China?&rdquo;, &ldquo;where do you like to go eat?&rdquo;, &ldquo;oh my, your husband plays guitar too?!&rdquo;&nbsp; We must be soul mates. I even asked what their astrological signs were. I know...&nbsp;pure desperation for some karmic force ensuring me this was &ldquo;The Couple&rdquo;.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I envisioned the four of us having nights out sans kids, laughing, drinking wine and then spending next Christmas together because neither one of us could afford to travel home for the holidays.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">So, we all decided to have our first date at Liquid Laundry and bring the kids (which actually was fine with me (kids can be a great escape route when needed, like when I used to be single and have my best friend call me 5 minutes into a blind date to tell me an emergency had happened and I had to leave. Now.)</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">We all met outside and her children had baked my son cupcakes. We kissed on the cheek as though we were meeting up from not seeing each other for years. We were all in our 30&rsquo;s and seemingly appeared to have a fighting chance at a successful first blind expat couple date.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Then we sat down. I did not like Liquid Laundry for our first date; but I sucked it up none the less. Pizza it was, I suppose. Then the misery began. She immediately&nbsp;gave her boring account of how much money she earns, how big her house is, her live-in Ayi (and I think she said that 5 times). Did she mention she had a live in Ayi? Oh, and I take taxis? Total travesty, because of course she has a driver.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Now in the scheme of things, none of this matters. I have a part time Ayi too. I don&rsquo;t need a driver and I&rsquo;m certainly not going to talk about my finances with some woman I just met.&nbsp;But we laughed and smiled and made plans for the next day so the kids could go swimming at my house. We took pictures to post on Facebook to share (ok, fine,&nbsp;to document publicly that I do have friends in China).&nbsp; And the next morning, they called to say they were sick and could not make swimming and we haven&rsquo;t heard from them since. Oh and those Facebook pics I posted, she promptly took them down (even though she swore to me, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never on Facebook, I am simply too busy&rdquo;).</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Yet, as men always seem to be able to&nbsp;(I don&rsquo;t know how), they hit it off.

After a fabulous two week vacation in New Zealand I&rsquo;m definitely feeling the post CNY blues! For two amazing weeks my family lounged on sandy beaches surrounded by gorgeous mountains and greenery, we ate over-priced fish and chips and ran after crabs in the mud, we saw glow worm caves and wild seals, we soaked in lots of sun and fresh air - and by the end of it, as it can be sometimes with long vacations, we were ready to come back home and back to normality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It all started on the plane. Actually, it started about 15 minutes before we got to the gate in Shanghai when then airline stewardess started screaming for everyone to sit back down while the plane was taxiing on the runway. Then about 3 minutes before docking at the gate all you heard was a sea of seatbelts unbuckling, bags being snatched down from overhead compartments, cellphone conversations, and the drowned out pleas of the stewards begging for order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next 1/2 hour was a blur of Visa checking, fighting for a luggage cart, fighting for a place to pick up our luggage, and being crammed into an elevator to the parking lot because maximum load be damned! And that&rsquo;s when it actually hit me: I&rsquo;m back.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So since then I&rsquo;ve been doing everything in my power to get back into the swing of things to feel normal again! Here are some of my tips that might help you to get over your post CNY funk:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Get active: So the sky is grey, that doesn&rsquo;t mean you cant get outside for a nice walk or jog! So slap on your 3M N95 face mask of choice and get to it! I&rsquo;ve already been back to bootcamp this week. And all those fish and chips are showing as I heave myself along at the back of the pack citing jet lag when I fully know it&rsquo;s the ball of grease firmly lodged in my gut.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Re-connect with friends: There is a 99.9% chance that your friend, recently returned from their fabulous trip, is feeling just the same way you are. Get together over Starbucks and chat about exactly how long it will be until you get to escape again!</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Take up a hobby: Myself, I&rsquo;ve taken up bread making which has giving me a new thing to focus my hate on besides the fact that I&rsquo;m no longer on vacation. Seriously, how can a bread maker fail in the ONE thing it&rsquo;s designed to do?! I&rsquo;ve gone through 3 different yeasts, 4 recipes, countless cups of flour, and many tears.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ditch original hobby, refocus on a better hobby: My bread maker is <em>this</em> close to taking a flying leap off the balcony and my new hobby will be making hooch in my downstairs guest bathtub.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Don&rsquo;t complain: Because chances are you will complain to that ONE friend who didn&#39;t go anywhere for CNY and then they will be all like hate-fire and &ldquo;count yourself lucky&rsquo;s&rdquo;.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Remind yourself why Shanghai is awesome: And indeed it is!

The reasons for this remarkable rise cannot merely be attributed, however, to narrowly focusing on teaching and learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:11.0pt\">Ed Venables, Stanley Housemaster at Wellington College UK, recently visited Wellington College Shanghai to talk about the pastoral techniques used in boarding houses (where some of the students reside during the week) for young people reach their full academic potential while also developing a sense of self-awareness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:11.0pt\">At all the Wellington schools, this is achieved primarily through &lsquo;coaching&rsquo; pupils. Coaching allows pupils to discover their values, to develop skills to be stronger and more efficient solvers of their problems throughout life. Most importantly, this approach removes the two-dimensional approach of teachers telling pupils what they should do or how they should react in any given situation. The desired result is achieved through teachers nurturing a good relationship with the students, using effective questions and good listening skills.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:11.0pt\">Coaching is about enabling teachers and parents to find a dialogue that removes judgment and ceases to impose outcomes, but rather requires others to analyse and to think pro-actively in finding their own solutions. Too often support of young people is wrongly labelled as a soft option of &lsquo;saying yes&rsquo; or &lsquo;being kind&rsquo;. Support and coaching must be robust, challenging and demanding, too. &nbsp;Used well they fuel that vital spark of self-motivation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:11.0pt\">Those techniques have generated and underpinned the success of the Wellington College in the UK and are being replicated here, in Wellington College Shanghai.

Lately, we&rsquo;ve become frequent patrons of <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/search-venues/mr%20pancake%20house\">Mr. Pancake House</a>. My son loves their waffles with icing sugar and my daughter enjoys their plain pancake and good &lsquo;ol bacon. My husband and I like to mix it up and indulge with piles of pancakes or crepes smothered in sweetness or savoury goodness, depending on our moods. This joint has an extensive menu that will definitely accommodate everyone&rsquo;s picky taste buds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Outdoor Spot</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We live steps away from the river, so our favorite outdoor spot is walking up and down the Huang Pu on the Pudong side. Sometimes we enjoy walking towards Nanpu Bridge (from the Zhangyang Lu ferry stop) where there is hardly ever any people. This direction is great for kids to run around and burn off energy as there is a boardwalk and a pedestrian walk with no access for vehicles (even e-bikes). On good days, you can see the Expo Chinese Pavilion shining like a red beacon just beyond the Nanpu Bridge, a great view.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes we walk towards Superbrand Mall (from Zhangyanglu ferry stop) to get a view of the skyscrapers piercing the landscape (our fav is still the Bottle Opener or <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/2647\">SWFC</a>). We usually go this direction in search of food at Superbrand or its proximity. In the summer, you can usually find us on a patio in one of the many eateries available in that area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Place to Play</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For outdoor play, we enjoy taking the kids to local parks. <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/2577\">Century Park</a> in Pudong is great green space with lots of activity if you want to do something with the kids. On weekends, it can get a bit crowded, but the park is so big that you can usually find a spot for just you and the family to kick a soccer ball or chase each other up and down the walkway. On the Puxi side, we&rsquo;ve recently discovered Lu Xun Park in Hongkou. We were told that it is one of the oldest parks in Shanghai and has recently undergone a major facelift. There is a manmade lake in the centre that makes the park very picturesque. Our favourite reason for returning to this park though is just to people watch. There are groups of retirees singing, practicing saxophones, flying kites, doing tai chi and even debating on daily events (the people are so animated in these debates, that it is just enthralling to watch even if you don&rsquo;t understand what they are saying).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Place to Go Without Kids</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a date night, we prefer to do something low key. Because massages are such a luxury back home, we try to enjoy the abundant massage services here. We frequent Bamboo Massage, a local chain that is pretty reasonable in price and consistent in service. We usually get the foot massage with scented oils. It&rsquo;s a great place to chat and unwind. Sometimes, when we don&rsquo;t feel like talking anymore, we put on our headphones and listen to our iPods while getting our feet rubbed. Best date option for those nights where you just want peace and quiet, but still want to be together.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Romantic Spot</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For couple time, we really don&rsquo;t have one spot. We usually enjoy strolling different neighbourhoods on the Puxi side since we reside on the Pudong side. We like to find random parks or locations on a map that we&rsquo;ve never been to (that&rsquo;s how we discovered Lu Xun Park in Hongkou). After strolls, we usually like to plant our tired feet at a small bar or lounge. Our favourite hangout is <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/search?search_item=cotton%27s\">Cotton&rsquo;s</a>&nbsp;- good music, charming space and good food.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Place to Go With Friends</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My outing with friends usually surrounds food. The most recent place we tried and went back to again is <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/9974\">Liquid Laundry</a>. Their pizza options are unique and so far, does not disappoint. But sometimes we like to get adventurous and do something local, like take a scooter ride to a migrant town or plan a day trip to Qibao and try a few of the million street food options . Our favourite street food is Lanzhou La Mien. A big hot bowl of soup and noodles always warms the soul (and friendships). Hot pot at <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/search?search_item=Hai+Di+Lao\">Hai Di Lao</a> is also a favorite for group gatherings.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Place to Travel</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our favorite romantic getaway was in Thailand at Six Senses Yao Noi. This resort was utter comfort and luxury at a secluded location in busy Thailand. We were perched high up in a villa that resembled a modern tree house on a small mountain overlooking the Andaman Sea, with no other tourists but the hotel guests and staff. It was truly a breathtaking view and tropical paradise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our favorite family vacation would be in Vietnam. To get away from the crowds and noises of the big city, we searched for a remote but family friendly resort. We found it in Angsana Lang Co. It is a 1.5 hour drive from Hanoi, but the resort was worth it. The kids loved the big swimming pools as well as our private pool in our large garden. It felt almost like home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a change of scenery, we&#39;ve also had great staycations right here at home. We love the <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/9664\">Puli</a> in Jing&rsquo;an. The service was outstanding, the hotel is beautiful, rooms are modern, and the pool is spectacular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Place to Shop</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best place to shop is online. I buy most of the packaged goods from pinstore.com or epermarket. For fresh groceries, I utilize the local wet market down the street from my home.&nbsp; For everything else, there is the All Powerful, All Amazing Taobao!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For fun-shopping, we like to hit up Huai Hai Lu. Or we enjoy browsing the labyrinth of shops in Tian Zi Fang.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Area of Shanghai</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our family went to Chongming Island in the summer. It turned out to be one of the best family day trips we&rsquo;ve made in Shanghai. Chongming Island is only a 1.5 hour drive from Pudong and it literally felt like we were transported into another province. If you are craving greenery, clearer air, blue skies, then Chongming Island is your ticket.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our kids loved their visit to the <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/9916\">Mahota Farm</a>, an active organic farm with an eco-tourist theme. We got a tour of the farm (given in English) and the kids got to get their hands dirty planting vegetables, feeding goats and pigs and just generally being entertained by the surroundings. We learned about organic farming and even had a hotpot meal prepared with farm vegetables and meats. It was truly a refreshing experience.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Place for Adventures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right here in Shanghai is where you can find endless adventure. Whether it&rsquo;s entering the plethora of shops under the Science Centre, or bargaining up a storm at the Lu Jia Bang fabric market, or trying your hands at picking out live fish at the local wet market, adventure is just lurking around the corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Place to Relax</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My couch by my window overlooking the Huang Pu is my favorite place to unwind with a mug of hot chocolate and a good book. Home sweet home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Favorite Memory of Shanghai</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shanghai is full of memories for us. Every bit of it - the good and the ugly &ndash; will forever be etched into our memory. There is no crowning moment but there are many unforgettable moments, like the birth of our second child, like the first time I heard myself speak Chinese without hesitation, like the many laughs I shared with my friends who have now become family.

Saturday was the first time I&rsquo;d seen blue skies AND clean air in so long in Shanghai and that put me right in the mood to have a little family outing. I&rsquo;ve been wanting to go to Painters&rsquo; Street in Xujiahui ever since I found out about it. I have zero wall space in my house, but I love art and was thinking of maybe cramming some sort of creative piece onto a wall in the playroom. So after swimming lessons we threw the kids in the car to Puxi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Feeling like a super-mom because not only did we make great time out of the house, we had everything we needed without forgetting anything: stroller - check! Refreshments - check! Diaper bag - check! Snack - double check!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It took about 30 minutes to drive to Painters&rsquo; Street, which I have to admit, was a little unimpressive at the entrance. But, once we got both kids out of the car I was excited to see some art and was already chuckling at the first piece which was a mural of the alphabet done in Simpsons&rsquo; characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before stepping into our first gallery, Kai asked for his snack; Tupperware of blueberries we had brought along. I opened up the container to let him have a handful to which he exclaimed: &ldquo;No! I want to hold the blueberries!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Kai, if you hold the box you&rsquo;ll spill it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai: &ldquo;I want to hold it!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Okay hold it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>*almost spills entire contents of two packages of blueberries on the ground&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Husband: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him hold it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: &ldquo;Okay I&rsquo;ll hold it and you just take some.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kai: &ldquo;I WANT TO HOLD IT!!!!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then it happened: in the middle of Painters&rsquo; Street, Kai let loose a tantrum of the likes he hasn&#39;t done in such a long time - and in public nonetheless. He is crying his face off, hopping up and down, and screaming sharp screeches like you would hear from the spawn of if an owl mated with a Velociraptor. Then Oren, following suit and unhappy with HIM not getting to hold the blueberry container either, started his own &ldquo;I&rsquo;m gonna scream and cry because this is what we&rsquo;re doing right now!&rdquo;-fit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not gonna pretend that this hasn&#39;t happened to us before. I mean, which parents have never gone through an all out tantrum from their 2-4-year-old? Or even their 15-year-old; let&rsquo;s be honest. And if you have that one friend that says &ldquo;Oh, my kid neeeever throws tantrums like that!&rdquo; then ditch that friend cause she is a liar and probably snoops in your medicine cabinet when she comes over for tea.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nothing we could do or say was making Kai and Oren stop. People started coming out of their stores to see why the foreigner kids were crying and why their crazy parents couldn&rsquo;t get them under control. At one point we even had two ladies coming up to us telling us to &ldquo;just give them what they want.&rdquo; or &ldquo;don&rsquo;t let them cry!&rdquo; and of course &ldquo;Awww little boys don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is also not our first rodeo with being the centre of attention and judgment during a public tantrum. When we first arrived in Shanghai we took a walk along the Bund which quickly turned into a scream and picture taking fest where we were surrounded by about 15 locals all laughing at our distress and a screaming struggling 2-year-old.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In a grand total of 12 minutes on Painters&rsquo; Street we were back in the car on our way back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I completely recognize that kids having tantrums is normal. And setting boundaries, creating limits, and following through on punishments like actually turning the car around from Disneyland and going home is very important. But it will never make sense to me that if parents are having a hard time why the spectacle in itself has to then turn into a three-ring circus for everyone to enjoy and participate in?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead of standing and staring, offer me a cup of tea&hellip;or even better a shot of baijiu because that is what I as a parent really need to make it though that moment. Or even better: look away because honestly there is nothing to see here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have to admit that ever since being the center of attention whenever my kids throw a tantrum, the minute I see a local baby wailing at the top of its lungs I feel a little <em>schadenfreude</em> for the parents&hellip; but I resist the urge to take a picture.

Culinary Director Alexandre Molina brings years of experience and expertise to the dining area of the club, and on March 29, he is hosting a kids&rsquo; cooking class with Urban Family and STCC.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alexandre started his formal culinary training at the School of Hotel And Tourism in Nice in 1983 with apprenticeship training at the Restaurant La Vie du Cros, Cagnes sur Mer, France. With a career spanning over 25 years of experience in the culinary field, he has worked with several Michelin starred chefs in Europe and extensively around Asia including Tokyo, Singapore and now Shanghai and the US. He has worked at hotels, independent restaurants, on cruiseships and even a stint as a private chef for a family in Connecticut, US.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We sat down with him to talk about the event as well as food and family in general.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You have worked in the culinary field in Europe, Asia and North America. Do you change the style of the food depending on where you are or do you try to keep a specific identity?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I do keep my personal identity, but at the same time, I mix different styles. I was born in France but my cooking is influenced by the Mediterranean cuisine as well; for example, I don&rsquo;t like to use too much butter and cream as I prefer olive oil. I also like to add some Asian influences, although I wouldn&rsquo;t call it a fusion as I don&rsquo;t go to any extremes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did you become interested in food?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I was about 11 or 12 years old, I realized that I was interested in cooking and that I wanted to be a chef. I used to watch my mother and my grandmother cook and I enjoyed helping out in the kitchen. My grandmother was from Spain and she used to cook traditional comfort food but always with a twist. She taught me a lot about food and gave me some influences from her home country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you get a lot of inspiration from Nice, your hometown?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, although I am influenced by different cuisines, I remember the different flavors and dishes I grew up with and they will always influence me in my work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>From around the world, what is your favorite cuisine?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course I would say the French, but I really like Chinese food too. Not so much the really oily dishes, but dim sum, sweet &amp; sour and spicy dishes are always favorites.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have you discovered any new ingredients you like to use since you started working in China?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, there are a lot of ingredients to discover here, for example all the beautiful fruits and vegetables. There are also a lot of different spices and sauces that I find interesting. I discovered that instead of using pasta dough when making ravioli, I could use wonton skin to stuff with meat or whatever I put inside.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>At STCC I imagine there are a lot of different nationalities. How do you cook for such a diverse crowd?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When we offer a six or eight course meal, I like to compose a mixed menu. A mix of Western, Chinese and Japanese dishes gives everyone an option, and I&rsquo;ve noticed that especially Germans love the concept of mixing western dishes while adding some Asian elements such as a Japanese soup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You have three children and now you are hosting a cooking class with parents and kids. What is it like to let kids take over your kitchen?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My children are 8, 9 and 10 years old and they really enjoy cooking with me. I don&rsquo;t see it as a problem because whenever I cook with children, I get to show them and teach them things and they enjoy helping. Although their favorite thing to make is usually pastries!</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tell us your thoughts on the menu you have prepared for this event.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The day before, we are hosting an eight course lobster gala dinner centered around ingredients from Nova Scotia. The cooking class will follow the same theme and we will be making lobster risotto from Nova Scotia, blueberry muffins and more for the lunch for children and parents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What do you and your family eat at home?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I always cook because my wife is working a lot. We usually eat western food, but my mother-in-law who is Singaporean has taught me a few things I sometimes apply to the dinners at home. I always put effort into the food I make for my family because I don&rsquo;t want our meals to be boring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you give any advice to busy parents who want to give their kids good home cooked food?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kids are always a bit difficult when it comes to fruit and vegetables. My tip is to incorporate a lot of vegetables into the food in a way that the children won&rsquo;t notice it. When my kids were babies I used to mix homemade puree from fruit and vegetables. I used to freeze it like ice cubes to always have something healthy to just defreeze. This idea has stuck with me and I still make mashed and mixed vegetables in different forms. When kids see a whole vegetable in its original shape they might refuse to eat it, but when it&rsquo;s hidden in some way, like chopped into small pieces and put into a lasagna, they can&rsquo;t tell and don&rsquo;t have a problem eating it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On March 29, Alexandre Molina, STCC and Urban Family are hosting a cooking class event for kids and parents. If you have a child above the age of 10, you have a chance to win a slot where the two of you get to cook (and eat!) an exclusive 3-course meal including lobster risotto and more (includes 2 hours play in the kids zone).

The International Baccalaureate qualifications have long been seen as a key for entrance to a good university and promising career. However, changing markets have led the IB to develop new, improved strategies. Building on excellent IBDP results (an average of 35 last year, compared to the world average of 29.8, with the highest marked score of 42) SSIS underwent testing and development to become the first school in China to start teaching IB Career-Related Program last year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IBCP is a rigorous two-year academic program that consists of three parts: IB Core, The Diploma Program courses and career-related courses. This offers the qualifications that universities demand and respect, but also a practical component that allowsAnchor students to gain crucial work experience while still at school. It is designed for students who wish to support their further studies while engaging in career-related learning. Currently, SSIS offers IBCP in Hospitality, with a view to expand into other fields such as sport, art and design.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The view that studying Hospitality it is not as prestigious as more traditional academic subjects is currently being strongly challenged. Forbes Magazine (February 2015) estimates that every 2.5 seconds in the world a job in the hospitality sector is created. The global industry provides around 8.9 per cent of worldwide employment and the World Travel and Tourism Council Board estimates by 2023 nearly one in ten jobs will be in hospitality.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Top recruiters from the retail and financial industries are seeking out more and more future managers and executives with Hospitality Degrees and training. JP Morgan, Bloomberg, Louis Vuitton, Shangri-La and Disney Land have all recently recruited from top Hospitality Institutes including Switzerland&rsquo;s Les Roches International School of Hotel Management. (The Telegraph, 4 Aug 2014).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At SSIS, instructors from professional hospitality management institution teach two classes a week. As well as IBDP courses, students may complete modules on Marketing, Customer Service, Human Resource Management and Front Office Operations in Hospitality, as well as developing practical and social skills, tackling ethical issues and improving their language skills (currently SSIS students are taking extra French and Japanese).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to the official IB website, the IBCP was &ldquo;specifically developed for students who wish to engage in career-related learning while gaining transferable and lifelong skills in applied knowledge, critical thinking, communication, and cross-cultural engagement.&rdquo; It allows students to gain prestigious credentials while studying something they are particularly passionate about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The IB 2013 Global Summit reported that while, &ldquo;worldwide, the rate of youth unemployment (ages 15 to 24) is 13 percent, according to the International Labour Organization (ILO),&rdquo; that for the students that had taken the IBCP, &ldquo;schools report that the vast majority of graduates (99%) have continued on to further or higher education, careers or specialized training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is certainly a very popular option for students currently taking it at SSIS.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grade 11 student Sean Lim says: &ldquo;If you want to learn about business and management I would encourage you to take this course, as you can learn more from this program then from a text book.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;I love the practical side of visiting hotels and restaurants and finding out what happens beneath the surface,&rdquo; says another student Alex Zeng, &ldquo;After completing my IBCP at SSIS I would like to go to College and study Business and Marketing.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our students are ambassadors for this program, and with that come great responsibility and great joy.

Fruits and vegetables which have been grown under strict organic regulations to significantly reduce the chemical residues ingested. It is advisable to go for organic when it comes to the dirty dozen lists. In fact as clean 15 contain relatively few pesticide residues; it is safer to consume them even in non-organic form.<br />\r\n<strong>Wash thoroughly:</strong> The idea behind is that you should do what you can do. Though it is not realistic to have high pressure washing at domestic kitchens, we can always wash it as thoroughly as possible to reduce the pesticide load.<br />\r\n<strong>Peel off the outer skin cover:</strong> This will &nbsp;bring you considerable reduction in pesticide exposure.<br />\r\n<strong>Cook up to a certain level</strong> will also bring down to lower pesticide exposure comparable to the raw produce.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Finally It needs to be emphasized that consumption of fruits and vegetables offers you plenty of health benefits such as preventing certain cancers, heart attacks, strokes and many more, so even thought it might feel challenging to avoid the intake of pesticides, it is worth doing whatever you can to get as much nutrition as possible.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">//Dr. Amali Sajeewika MD, Family medicine, Pediatrics and Women&#39;s health, JJ - Premier Medical care, Ruidong Hospital &nbsp;(Jinqiao-Pudong), Shanghai, P.R. China, amalis@jjpremier.com</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Special thanks goes to Laure Perriot, Expat Marketing Director, Fields, China for the 2015 update on dirty dozen and clean 15.</span></em></p>'), ('1', '1', '180', '1', '<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">When I first arrived in Shanghai it was January, the air was grey and the skies were even greyer. I was 10 weeks pregnant and Kai was a big ball of 2 year old sass-mouth with a ton of energy to burn. I had just spent the first week lying on the couch in the apartment with all of the furniture pushed into the living room to corner Kai off in the attempt to keep him in one spot just in case I fell asleep at any moment. Going outside for me was a mixture of fear and denial with thought&rsquo;s of: &ldquo;Where will we eat?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What do I do if I get lost?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Will my driver just wait for me outside?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Where did my driver go, I thought he was supposed to wait outside?&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I would never admit it at the time but I was completely lost in my new surroundings and Kai was getting more and more bored by the day. We spent our waking hours avoiding grocery shopping by eating at Element Fresh, buying any DVD that would keep him quiet for an hour, and fighting with the internet because I really missed Facebook. By the way, Kai had just turned 2 and about a week into it he decided to turn into an absolute nightmare. I knew about the terrible twos but nothing prepared me for this. So, cooping up an absolutely insane toddler with a pregnant lady who could barely engage long enough to heat up a leftover macaroni kid&rsquo;s meal from Element Fresh was a ticking time bomb.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I decided I had to get out. And so with elaborate sign language I asked my driver to take us to the Kerry and instead ended up at Thumb Plaza, but I rolled with it. Trying my best to steer Kai away from the toy kiosk, I took him up an escalator and there it was: an indoor playground in all its glory. Sure, it was a little worn, dirty, and had a highly questionable ball pit; but it was somewhere Kai could run and I could SIT!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Since that moment, every other day was spent frequenting the latest and greatest indoor playground I could find. And when I couldn&rsquo;t find another I would rotate back to the first because he was two and had the memory span of a hamster so it wasn&rsquo;t like he knew the difference.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Indoor playgrounds became my saving grace. Would I travel all the way to Honqiao just because they also had a cafe where I could supervise while drinking a tea latte? Oh yes I would! &nbsp; &nbsp; Would I pay exorbitant prices *cough* Adventure Zone at the Kerry *cough* just to spend a rainy day and ensure that Kai goes down for a solid 3 hour nap? Oh yes I would!&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I imagine that the need for indoor playgrounds came about due to the combination of bad air quality and rainy season. Playtime had to be brought inside because with the hazardous AQI it just wasn&rsquo;t possible to play outside. That in itself is kinda sad - that these areas of such fun and joy for kids were created because there was no other option.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">So far, the kids&rsquo; favorite places to play are at Thumb Plaza and also Laya Plaza, the Himalayas (Wonderland on&nbsp;the basement level), and at the Children&rsquo;s Market on Pu&rsquo;an Lu. All of these places have great playgrounds guaranteed to keep your wee ones busy until nap time.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">So on your next rainy day where the kids are driving you crazy and you just don&rsquo;t know what to do - visit your nearest mall because chances are there will be an indoor playground to kill a few hours.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Just remember: bring hand sanitizer and always be suspicious of the ball pit.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">So gross.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">xoNiki</span></p>'), ('1', '1', '181', '1', '<p><span style=\"font-size:10px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Spoil yourself with an over-the-top experience for both the sweet and savory inclined this Easter!

Just seeing those three words in print don&rsquo;t evoke a warm and fuzzy &ldquo;sit by the campfire and roast marshmallows&rdquo; feeling; particularly for the spouse &ldquo;trailing&rdquo; behind the other spouse. I almost envision this poor spouse being dragged by her ponytail; however I have been called overdramatic on more than one occasion, so this may just be my personal opinion. So, fine. Fair. She is being dragged by her chic BOB haircut, not her ponytail.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I have lived in China long enough to have played every relationship role and somehow have lived to write about it with an &ldquo;intact sense of humor&rdquo;. Sometimes I still gag when I speak of my prior relationship &ldquo;learning lessons&rdquo;, so I prefer writing about them, because it gives me less of a heartburn.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I have been single in China, dated in China, seriously dated in China, seriously not dated in China, lived with someone in China (they moved out after 2 weeks&hellip; hold&hellip; I am gagging&hellip; you were warned) and now for the first time, I am married in China. And the &ldquo;trailing spouse&rdquo; in my case is my husband; not me.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">My Beloved (MB) is doing what most &ldquo;trailing female spouses&rdquo; do; take care of the children, clean the house, grocery shop, contend with Ayis, take the children to school and enter a country they would not have necessarily chosen, but decided to for the betterment of the family unit.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">For all you mothers/fathers who are stay-at-home-parents; I would like to bestow a crown of glory on thy head now if I could, because I would need cocktails at noon if I had to be at home with my 3-year-old lovely son all day. I would fear for my liver. And I like my liver.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">&nbsp;I will share something with you that I expect to stay among us friends. There are days when I have worked 10 hours and literally have not had time to pee or eat, only to come home to MB wanting to show me the new cleaner he found for our microwave at Pines Market, only to be followed by a 10 minute monologue telling me how incredible it looks and wanting my immediate adoration complete with an impromptu cheerleading song with pom poms. These are the nights, I ask myself, &ldquo;Am I on a hidden camera show? Is this my life?&rdquo; You know, the shows where they test people&rsquo;s patience and after X amount of time, they win money? Nope, friends. No money, unless I find RMB1 under my couch cushion.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">&nbsp;Does my darling of a husband understand that I have just endured a 10 hour work day which consisted of meetings, hiring, firing, emergencies, report writing, HR meetings, deadlines, managing 30 people and taxi drivers?? &nbsp;5 taxi drivers to be exact, if you aren&rsquo;t counting the one that kicked me out for no apparent reason yesterday.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I used to yell and scream at MB for literally accosting me at the front door when I crawled in from work (when I say used to, I mean last night). However, I am beginning to understand that being in his position all day has its hardships too and perhaps I should exercise more patience with him since I have no time to exercise at the gym. Thus, being the selfish wife I can be&hellip; I have decided to re-evaluate ways to encourage some semblance of marital bliss for MB and I and the sanity of my son and 2 cats. Plus, I do like a clean microwave.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I had to have a &ldquo;sit down&rdquo; with my darling of a spouse and explain 1) before I have even stepped foot in the front door, please do not pounce on me before I have even taken my shoes off to show me how clean the house is, the new garden you planted outside or how nice the house smells because you changed the kitty litter. It is not that I don&rsquo;t care about these things. In truth, I care about them a great deal. But I need 30 minutes to &ldquo;decompress&rdquo; after work. This includes: taking shoes off, changing into my pajamas, having a glass of wine, devoting some time to my 3-year-old and getting dinner prepared. After I have basked in the glory of 30 whole minutes to myself in a 24 hour day; I am tickled pink to hear about MB&rsquo;s day (for once I am not being sarcastic). 2) I actually have to make an effort to remember that MB has probably been home most of the day, cleaning, talking to very few people whom he can communicate with, taking care of a 3-year-old very active boy and literally is &ldquo;chomping at the bit&rdquo; to get some adult interaction from me right away and some validation that what he is doing is contributing to the family and is valuable.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I almost feel guilty writing that last sentence. Who doesn&rsquo;t want validation? Moving on&hellip; I did say almost guilty. The point being is that every marriage is difficult and each spouse wants some form of validation at the end of the day.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I know this is amplified for expat marriages where the &ldquo;trailing spouse&rdquo; often doesn&rsquo;t have the family or friends&rsquo; support they once had. &nbsp;Conversely, the spouse who led the trailed spouse, often is working in a culturally unfamiliar working environment, are working longer hours, learning different labor laws and a multitude of other factors which cause the entire family&rsquo;s stress level to reach a breaking point. So before you reach the breaking point, put on the brakes. At least I will attempt downshifting this week.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">I&rsquo;m winding this article down for the night, so I can go look at the microwave MB spent hours cleaning and I am leaving a post it note for MB thanking him for cleaning the vile microwave machine (he was correct: it was &ldquo;college dorm, frat house&rdquo; vile). I may even write, &ldquo;I love you&hellip; wifey&rdquo;.</span></p>');

You&rsquo;ve probably already been there, but your kids will have fun revisiting pandas, elephants and monkeys any time.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\"><strong>Go for a bike ride</strong><br />\r\nAlthough one of the best ways to explore Shanghai is by bike, we recommend you to avoid the heavily trafficked areas if you&rsquo;re bringing your kids. Century Park is a good starting point (where you can also rent bicycles) and from there you can make your way to Laoshan Lu and Zhaojiabang Canal. Scenic views of the waterway and great picnic spots are offered, and it is a great route for kids as there are no hills and no traffic.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '189', '1', '<p><span style=\"font-size:10px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Join the Expatriate Professional Women&rsquo;s Society (EPWS) for an&nbsp;&ldquo;Evening in the Sky,&rdquo;&nbsp;this year&rsquo;s highly-anticipated annual gala event.

In this issue of Urban Family, the Learning section (p. 20 &ndash; 29) introduces some of the best schools when it comes to sports. If your kids don&rsquo;t attend any of these schools, they can still be part of some excellent programs such as the Aussie Rules Football &ldquo;AusKick&rdquo; program for kids (p. 32) and they can play basketball or soccer in the Shanghai Youth Basketball Development League and Shanghai International Youth Soccer League (p. 30 &amp; 34).&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, with sports come problems such as injuries, pre-game anxiety and conflicts. On page 44, clinical psychologist Dr. Nate Balfanz talks about how to help your child get past anxiety before a big game, fitness expert Alan Leung talks about how to define your fitness goals and choose a sport while taking the risks into account (p. 46) and Matt Kuykendall helps you deal with the nightmare coach (p. 36).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>// Download the April Issue of Urban Family&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/pdf/75/download\">here</a>, or view it on your browser with Issuu&nbsp;<a href=\"http://issuu.com/urbanfamilycn/docs/1504uf\">here</a>.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>PS.

It is important to keep in mind, however, that with sports participation comes an inherent risk of injury or illness, which in some cases can be serious or even life-threatening. Every year, youth sport participants run the risk of conditions ranging from musculoskeletal injuries and concussions to heat illnesses and even sudden cardiac arrests.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Safeguarding kids against sports injuries means educating them on the proper preparation and conditioning required to safely take part in certain physical activities. This is especially true for educational institutions that offer sports participation as part of a student&rsquo;s overall education. Schools can best serve their student-athletes by having on-site medical professionals specially trained to treat sports-related injuries and conditions should they happen to occur.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Certified Athletic Trainer (ATC), I am a health professional specializing in the prevention, assessment, treatment and rehabilitation of injuries and illnesses that occur in athletes and the physically active. An ATC is an immediate healthcare provider and resource for nearly any medical situation, and are fairly common in the United States. You can find us working for universities, high schools, physical therapy clinics, the military, sport performance groups, hospitals or orthopedic clinics. We are the people you may have seen on TV running onto the field to help an injured athlete.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Shanghai, I am employed by the Institute for Western Surgery (IWS), an American orthopedic group in China, and contracted to Concordia International School to perform these duties. IWS Athletic Training Internship Program was conceived in 2010, and each year it sends four ATCs to work with international schools and community sports organizations in China. IWS employs three full-time Western-trained doctors: a pain management specialist, a sports medicine surgeon and a pediatric and spine surgeon.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My daily duties for the student-athletes at Concordia include first-aid management, treatment and rehabilitation of injuries, sports practice and game coverage, medical documentation and physician referrals. I also serve as a wellness coordinator for the Concordia staff. I meet daily with faculty, individually or in groups, to consult on nutrition, fitness, medical conditions and orthopedic issues. I provide a variety of health-enhancing services &mdash; fitness programs, personal training and injury rehabilitation exercises.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Many sports-related injuries occur due to a lack of physical preparation before participating in a sport or activity. Conditioning, strength, agility and flexibility are essential components for sport and overall health. If an individual fails to have a foundation in these areas, there can be a breakdown in the kinetic chain. We usually see this develop into tendonitis, muscle strains, shin splints, severe muscle soreness, etc. Having a decent fitness baseline enables an individual to perform better and decrease his/her chances of injury. Students can accomplish this by working with their coach and PE teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If a child or other member of the family sustains an injury while playing a sport and you don&rsquo;t have access to an ATC, seek treatment from your current physician or healthcare personnel. For serious injuries, request recommendations or second opinions. Before committing to any health service or professional, ask about their education, experience and training. For orthopedic issues, do not underestimate the need for physical rehabilitation. Be wary of any physician that wants to jump straight into surgery. When working with a rehabilitation professional (physical therapist, physiotherapist, athletic trainer), be sure to get value out of their services &ndash; ask for a home exercise program.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Living overseas can be stressful enough, and if combined with a medical issue or injury, it can be overwhelming. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a good idea for expatriate families to create their own emergency action plan with a list of qualified medical specialists such as: general practitioner, orthopedic, OB/GYN, ophthalmologist, dentist, etc. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll also want directions to the closest hospital with an international patient department. Ambulances are usually limited in medical supplies and have a long response time - a taxi is likely the best option, especially here in Shanghai. Preparing contact information ahead of time, with reputable physician contacts, will allow individuals to be quickly referred to the care they require.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Jared Maisel, MS, ATC, CSCS</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Institute for Western Surgery/Concordia International School Shanghai</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Athletic Trainer/Wellness Coordinator</p>'), ('1', '1', '193', '1', '<p><em><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">At the British International School Shanghai, Puxi campus, the Under 19 Division 1 girls&rsquo; basketball team have inspired some of the younger students to want to play the game and be part of a team like the BISS Lions.</span></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">After coming to watch the triumphant BISS Lions team play at the ACAMIS basketball tournament hosted by BISS Puxi earlier this year, a number of Year 6 girls were so impressed that they announced that the older girls were their new &lsquo;sporting heroines&rsquo; and that they wanted to get their autographs!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:arial,sans-serif; font-size:10pt\">Their teachers and the basketball coaches were keen to encourage this interest and so arranged for the girls to meet some of the basketball team and have lunch together.

A special performing arts program is taking place at Nord Anglia&rsquo;s 31 schools across the world, two of them including BISS Puxi and Pudong.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Urban Family asked Christopher Mossey, Senior Managing Director for Educational and Artistic Affairs at Juilliard Global Ventures, some questions about the international collaboration.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the goal with the Juilliard-Nord Anglia Performing Arts Programme?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are several goals with the new collaboration: to inspire and equip Nord Anglia students with skills, curiosity, and cultural literacy to engage with the performing arts throughout their lives; to provide the Nord Anglia family of schools with access to learning and teaching models co-developed with Juilliard, the world&rsquo;s leading performing arts conservatory; to provide unparalleled opportunities for Nord Anglia&rsquo;s students to work with experts in the performing arts, both inside and outside of the classroom; and to build a cooperative teaching community between Nord Anglia and Juilliard that strives for excellence in the delivery of performing arts education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You have put a lot of focus into global collaborations in recent years. Why do you think this is important?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the strengths of Juilliard is its international network of high quality performers and teachers that make an impact on cultural affairs every day around the world. We are tapping into that network so that Juilliard can become more pervasive in a global sense, so that people outside of New York can have access to the excellence that makes Juilliard so special. Through the accomplishments of its alumni, the Juilliard &lsquo;brand&rsquo; is very strong &ndash; market research from 2014 indicated that the Juilliard name is known by 66% of Chinese, for example. In addition, around 30% of Juilliard&rsquo;s student population consists of international students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is Juilliard the best school in the world for studying the performing arts? What other schools do you think are on a similar level?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many excellent performing arts schools in the United States (and abroad). What distinguishes Juilliard from other schools is its location in New York City at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, a campus of eleven professional performing arts presenters that includes the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. Many of our faculty members are working professionals in these organizations. Juilliard is unique in that it offers programs across three broad categories of performing arts &ndash; music, dance, and drama, and Juilliard also functions as an active presenter of high quality performances &ndash; more than 700 per year &ndash; that give students opportunities to perform in front of a discerning public.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What can students expect to learn from the program?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Over time, students in the Juilliard-Nord Anglia program will be exposed in the classroom to numerous forms of music, dance, and drama, covering a wide array of genres and cultures. Juilliard and Nord Anglia are working together to design a curriculum that is accessible, engaging and deep. Students will also undertake &ldquo;hands on&rdquo; activities that will help them learn the languages of the performing arts, such as reading music, and will participate in activities that bring out their own creativity, all the while learning within a framework infused with Juilliard&rsquo;s excellence. In addition, Juilliard plans to leverage its network of performers and teachers to engage directly with Nord Anglia schools around the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What kind of expertise do you have to offer?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Juilliard has played a significant role in K-12 education for nearly 100 years. Juilliard&rsquo;s faculty, students, and alumni regularly teach in education programs for younger children. Our audition-based Pre-College Program, which takes place on Saturdays in New York, was founded in 1918; in that program, talented students, ages 8-18, study directly with Juilliard faculty. In addition, for the past 25 years, Juilliard has trained students with the skills to be &ldquo;artist-teachers&rdquo; &ndash; high quality performers who are excellent at engaging educationally and creatively with young people of all ages and talent levels.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can you give any advice to students who would like to get accepted to a prestigious and competitive school such as Juilliard?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The most important thing that any student can do is to find any and every way to immerse themselves in their art. Finding good teachers and training, opportunities to perform, looking in their community and outside of it to constantly find inspiration through attending performances, learning more about their art, and to deepen their understanding of what it is to be an artist. Through www.juilliard.edu, Juilliard can refer your child to a teacher in the area.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your graduates have been very successful over the years, with numerous achievements such as Grammys, Academy Awards, Pulitzers, etc. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Our training programs are rigorous and highly connected to the highest standards of the music, dance and drama professions. We offer numerous performance opportunities at Juilliard in New York in a performance environment that mirrors the professional world. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The admittance percentage to Juilliard is extremely low. Who is the typical Juilliard student and how can you tell if someone has what it takes?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ultimately, the audition is how we evaluate the artistic talent and potential of an applicant. However, the preparation for the audition is very telling - the length and quality of the training the student has had; the depth and breadth of their experience as a musician, dancer or actor; the immersion in the art form which can be demonstrated by how they choose to spend their time outside of school and in the summers. We have seen that talent can flourish anywhere, though &ndash; students who have limited resources and access surprise us on a regular basis with their passion and potential!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are you planning on a more long-term collaboration with Nord Anglia?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes. Juilliard and Nord Anglia will be announcing other elements of the program in the future.&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '200', '1', '<p>One of my favourite things about being part of this vast expat community is that you could meet someone from anywhere else in the world. Chances are if you strike up a casual conversation with a few people over the week you&rsquo;ll meet someone from a different country each time and, they in turn, have probably also lived abroad in a few different countries themselves.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This makes for great conversations and a lot of destinations for you to add to your vacation bucket list but it makes for some very awkward greetings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coming from Canada I&rsquo;m accustomed to three types of greetings: hugs, handshakes, and casual nodding. Hugs are for family and friends; people you have known for a while and feel totally comfortable smooshing chests with in a heartfelt hello and goodbye.&nbsp;I&#39;ve got this greeting down and insist upon it regardless of whether the receiver has full comfort with it or not - but they usually do, I&#39;m beyond huggable!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Handshakes are reserved for those who&nbsp;I&rsquo;m meeting for the first time or I&rsquo;m meeting for business. I make sure to always shake hands firmly as I was once told by my sociology teacher that women with assertive handshakes are more respected. Also who wants to shake a limp hand? No one I&rsquo;ll tell you!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And lastly, the casual nod is for all those people in between - the people who I&rsquo;ve already met but am not on hugging terms with yet. Those who haven&#39;t moved fully into squish chest territory but also can&rsquo;t be greeted with a second assertive handshake, because that would be weird.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;ve grown up knowing and practicing these 3 greetings. I know them well, I rely on them. And then I started living in China. Having friends from all over the world meaning having to learn and master new forms of greeting.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Right away I was introduced to the kiss cheek. The kiss cheek must never be confused with the kiss ON the cheek; that is a fine line that you can unfortunately never come back from. The line where your &quot;Hello friend!&quot;&nbsp;just turned into &ldquo;OMG DID I? MAYBE SHE DIDN&rsquo;T NOTICE!? *awkward silence*&rdquo;. The kiss cheek is executed by either pressing cheeks and kissing to the side of the other person&rsquo;s face, or not actually making cheek contact but still kissing in their general ear direction. It&rsquo;s hard to tell whether you should actually make cheek to cheek contact but I feel like if I go 45% and then they make up the last 55% for the cheek press that I&rsquo;m in the clear. Typically my UK friends are the ones that do this the most. I&rsquo;m totally down with it until I get that ONE person who insists on going the wrong way for the initial kiss cheek. So then you end up doing this awkward almost make out or accidental full on lip kiss that just makes both parties go &ldquo;it&rsquo;s okay! Hahaha!&rdquo;. However, your inner self isn&#39;t laughing, no, it&rsquo;s hiding in a corner under its embarrassment blanket.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there is the single kiss cheek. Now you may think&nbsp;this is the same as the kiss cheek itself but I will tell you it isn&#39;t. The single is different because it comes with many chances for ultimate awkwardness. Not only do you have to anticipate what side to do the single kiss cheek on, but you also have to know that it truly is a single and not a double. You don&rsquo;t want to just go for the two when the other party only intended on the one. But you also don&rsquo;t want to go in for one and pull out too early leading to your friend going &ldquo;no no! I&rsquo;m from (insert country here) we do it twice&rdquo;.&nbsp;The WORST is when you dance around the first kiss cheek, figure that out, then go in for the second but get rejected. #dyinginside</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Today I pulled out the double kiss cheek out of my greeting arsenal to say goodbye to my friends at lunch. I was told I was &ldquo;very European&rdquo; which I&rsquo;m sure means my kiss cheek etiquette is getting quite confident.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But let&rsquo;s just make a deal: if you intend to kiss cheek me three times I&rdquo;m going to need that in writing so I&rsquo;m aptly prepared.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '201', '1', '<p>Every mom has a sweet tooth, so is there a better way to celebrate Mother&rsquo;s Day than by whipping up a little indulgence?

The season when some of us are creating our packing lists for heading home for the summer and others are packing up for good. It&rsquo;s that time when some of us are moving on to the next country, next adventure, or just back home and back to normalcy. I feel like this year more than others, people are moving out of Shanghai to repatriate or start their next assignment.

When the news came out that she&#39;d be moving back to Toronto I was like: meh whatever, we still have time! But that time has slowly slipped through our fingers and her moving day is Thursday!

It&rsquo;s never easy but I always try to look at it with a glass-half-full attitude. I think of it like: yes I&rsquo;m losing a friend I can have lunch with, but I&rsquo;m gaining a friend I can visit in a new country! However, that doesn&rsquo;t make the feeling of never knowing which friend is the next on the plane easier. It can be a bit exhausting playing the game of &ldquo;are you leaving? No? Yes?

I&rsquo;ll always have the memory of shutting down Hai Di Lao and being asked to leave when my friend just couldn&#39;t stop eating. I&rsquo;ll always be able to tell the story of a friend running out of ladies night only to be found no longer wearing her dress in the back of my car.

INSERT INTO `th_contents` VALUES ('1', '1', '204', '1', '<p>I have to admit, I didn&#39;t even know what Uber was until pretty late in the game. Since I live in Jinqiao and am lucky enough to have a driver, it&rsquo;s pretty rare that I ever even need to get in a city cab - though I do and the kids and I have the &ldquo;Mommy-is-a-human-seatbelt cuddle&rdquo; down pat. It was only when my friend told me about Uber that I really clued into it and began to check it out. Turns out Uber has been around longer that I&rsquo;d shamefacedly like to admit. I usually pride myself on being on the forefront of the latest &ldquo;thing&rdquo; but I was definitely late to the Uber game. So I downloaded the app and have used it a grand total of 0.4 times. I say 0.4 because that is how fast I hung up on my first Uber driver to call me once I ordered him to my house (my taxi ended up showing up anyway).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I have no problems with the service - it&rsquo;s definitely filling a need for more reliable (I guess?) and safe (suuure?) forms of transportation around the city. I kinda kick myself for not knowing about Uber sooner when I ended up having to walk 10 blocks in heels to a dinner party because there were absolutely no cabs showing up after calling 5 times and waiting 40 minutes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I will say that my reluctance to use the service comes from my general wariness of the whole concept. So people just drive around using their cars to pick people up? Back in my grandmother&rsquo;s day she would call this &ldquo;men driving around in vans trying to kidnap kids.&rdquo; Only thing they&rsquo;re missing is the promise of a puppy or candy. Instead they charge you peak hours pricing that I only want to read about on buzzfeed and not experience firsthand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think what bothers me the most about Uber is the potential for family drivers to moonlight with the service. Now before you go all &ldquo;aww lady with the chauffeur doesn&#39;t want anyone in her car&rdquo; just hear me out. I used to keep a lot of stuff in the car. With two small kids that means toys, games, movies, water bottles (foogo ones, those aren&#39;t cheap baby!), and anything else that you just need to shove in your car so you can pull it out at the first inkling of a car tantrum while stuck in traffic. Not to mention that we have two really good car seats in the back that are perfectly adjusted for my kids and what parent wants to readjust those things all the time? NO ONE.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not saying my driver is secretly taxiing for Uber. All I&rsquo;m saying is there were snacks on the car seat and my hard earned Metro &ldquo;buy a whole bunch of crap and get stickers to get a subpar paring knife&rdquo; collection sheet was gone. I bought a bunch of crap for that knife guys and I&rsquo;ll never get the knife!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fact that family drivers may be Uber driving gets my back up. It&rsquo;s like if your uncle took your car out and drove it around with some stranger in it for a while and then you get it back and the seat that you finally adjusted perfectly to the exact position you wanted is all jacked up. Our cars become an extension of our homes, and having people who we don&rsquo;t know being carted around in it for a little extra cash is the same as a stranger walking into your house, sitting on your couch, and walking back out again with no explanation. And I&rsquo;m not just speculating about this whole thing. My friends have reported being picked up in vans with car seats in the back and my driver has pointed out Uber drivers who work for companies he knows.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I suggest if you do Uber and you get picked up by an expat van (we all know the ones&hellip;they&rsquo;re exactly the same color) that you tuck a little note somewhere just to let the family know. I&rsquo;m sure they&rsquo;d appreciate it. At least I would! That way I would know not to be so uncaring about the amount of used tissue I stuff into the door. I stuff a lot. Like, A LOT.&nbsp; Maybe I&rsquo;d actually clean up after myself. Or maybe not, so someone would give my driver a bad rating about the sea of booger wipes they waded through in the back seat and he&rsquo;d move on to just charging ridiculous amounts of overtime like the good &lsquo;ol days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yep I like that idea better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '205', '1', '<p>Disney fans unite!

You know, the sorts of flavor profiles and tastes that most kids will never go near.

Your days are filled with getting kids dressed, taking kids to school, doing grocery shopping to make sure the kids have enough of whatever they&rsquo;ve decided to only eat this week, picking up the kids, making dinner, putting kids to bed, then falling asleep on the couch after eating too much cheese. Okay maybe that last one is just me.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What I&rsquo;m getting at is that most of the time moms (and dads too) get too consumed in everyday life. We go about our days and daily routines thinking that we take time for ourselves when really we barely steal minutes to do the things we want to do; if we&rsquo;re lucky. Three times a week I decide to steal at least an hour of my day to work out. Joining Shanghai Fitness 443 in the Willowbrook compound has been one of the best decisions I&rsquo;ve made. Before then I was stealing minutes with getting my nails done or getting a foot massage, but this is one stolen moment that I can actually say has led to some positive change in my life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I used to HATE working out. I absolutely loathe gyms and gym atmospheres. That&rsquo;s why when I found 443 it fit perfectly with everything I was looking for in a place to work out: small class sizes, personal attention from your teacher, and a sense of camaraderie amongst classmates. Opposed to some, I actually don&rsquo;t like being anonymous while I sweat, I like to have people around me who know me and say: &ldquo;Look at you Sweaty McSweaterson! Get a towel!!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This past week I was fortunate enough to join Jill and other members of 443 on a fitness retreat to Thailand. Twice a year, Jill, who by the way was a dietician on The Biggest Loser and who is an excellent trainer, takes a group of her students to Phuket to whip them into holiday shape and kickstart their fitness goals before going on either Christmas or summer vacation. There were 18 of us, doing about 5-6 hours of activity a day including beach workouts, hill intervals, yoga, Pilates, and aqua-fit. Despite all of this, hands down the hardest workout was being at the bottom of the steps to our villa at the end of a workout and knowing that you were 40 steps away from a plunge in the pool or food. 40 steps doesn&rsquo;t seem like much until after you&rsquo;ve run a 75 degree hill in Phuket temperatures. You&rsquo;ve never wished so hard for an escalator or one of those senior citizen motorized stair chairs more in your life. How three small flights of stairs could be so hard I can never actually express, but believe me they were.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although most of us aren&#39;t as lucky as me to take 4 days to themselves to sweat up a storm somewhere, if you do have the opportunity, don&rsquo;t pass it up. Do something big just for yourself, whether it&rsquo;s fitness related or something to soothe the soul. Keeping yourself happy and grounded is the key to keeping your family life balanced. Even if it&rsquo;s once a month or once a year, taking some hard earned time to better yourself makes coming back to your family that much sweeter - and not killing your kids that much easier.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For about a week.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '213', '1', '<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Everyone still has an inner child and what better way to enjoy your youth and a day with your kids than with the Children&rsquo;s Day Buffet at the Renaissance Shanghai Pudong Hotel&rsquo;s Brassiere.

You know that movie right? I&rsquo;m too lazy to Google it.

Ah, yoga pants, the skinny people&rsquo;s maternity pants). But of course real people pants in my size don&rsquo;t actually exist in Shanghai which meant I was trying my hand at custom jeans. That day it was pouring sheets of rain. I never actually knew what that meant until that day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember my driver was driving under a highway and we drove through what can only be described as a giant waterfall. I had never seen that much water coming down in my life. I remember he pulled up to the fabric market, opened the door and laughed as I stared at the space between myself and the door. A mere 20 meters seemed like a giant football field that was being flooded by the days of Noah&rsquo;s Ark. He also laughed at the fact that I sighed very loudly when I realized I didn&rsquo;t have anything resembling an umbrella.

Lying is fine - your ayi is sick today, you have to clean your goldfish tank, you really have to catch up on macram&eacute;, you have to learn what macram&eacute; is; whatever, it&rsquo;s better than being damp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. If you NEED to go outside - which I&rsquo;ve already said don&rsquo;t, buy the largest most obnoxious umbrella you can find. Like think golf umbrella, then go bigger. If you can fit all of your family and a few friends under it you probably have the right size. Maybe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. Resist the urge to buy your 5-year-old (and under) an umbrella of their own. You know what that leads to? I&rsquo;ll tell you: &ldquo;Kai hold the umbrella properly! WHAT are you doing!? The umbrella is NOT to catch water with it&rsquo;s to keep the water off of you! See now you&rsquo;re just as wet as if I didn&#39;t bring the umbrella at all. And now you broke it in half. Great.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. Ensure that your personal umbrella makes you happy. For example my giant sized umbrella is rainbow colored. Whenever I look up at it I&rsquo;m like: OOOOOOH PRETTY! While everyone else with their depressing black umbrellas are like: I hate life! And are THIS close to throwing themselves into traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6. Get rain boots. I can&rsquo;t stress this enough. Even the baby should have rain boots. My son had rain boots before he could walk and only because the Shanghai rain finds some way to get into their shoes whether they touch the ground or not. It&rsquo;s like the devil&rsquo;s rain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7. Buy as much bug spray as possible. I suggest straight up bathing in it. Those mosquitoes ain&rsquo;t playin&rsquo;. They&rsquo;re coming for your face. And your ankles. Ankle mosquito bites are literally the worst.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But my ultimate tip for surviving the rainy season in Shanghai:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try to enjoy it. Because beyond all that grey cloud there are bright blue skies and rainbows. But you&rsquo;ll probably never see them because the rain will NEVER STOP. Nope. Now excuse me while I remain damp and hiding under a blanket in my living room for the next month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>#damp</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '219', '1', '<p>By Emersyn Lyon, grade 9 student at Concordia International School Shanghai</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Being a part of Concordia&rsquo;s 2015 spring musical, <em>Once Upon A Mattress, </em>was absolutely magical&mdash;and not just because it&rsquo;s a fairy tale. As a cast member, it&rsquo;s amazing how quickly the five months of rehearsal whirl by. One day you&rsquo;re practicing your lines in the mirror, and then suddenly you&rsquo;re face to face with the stomach-knotting day&mdash;opening night. For everyone involved in the production, the day begins at four o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. The dressing rooms are crowded with people adjusting costumes, applying makeup, and perfecting hair. Makeup is scattered haphazardly all around the dressing tables and a misty haze of hairspray fills the room. As time ticks by, the anxiety rises. Just when it seems the buzzing will explode, it&rsquo;s time for places.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The lights dim and the orchestra melodically play the opening tune. A spotlight descends upon the stage and Jonathan Tai, the Minstrel, begins the story. Unsuspecting viewers watch in amazement as the show unveils itself. Through the <em>true</em> story of the Princess and the Pea, the audience follows various characters through their journey in this musical. They marvel at Elizabeth Metzger&rsquo;s amazingly original performance as Princess Winifred&mdash;otherwise known as Fred. They adore the romantic and forbidden love story between Lady Larkin and Sir Harry. The small children boo at the evil Queen Aggravain and the Wizard, her right hand woman. They laugh in delight over the Minstrel, the Jester, and the mute King Sextimus, played by Jonathan Miao, who was clearly the crowd&rsquo;s ultimate favorite. He was able to dazzle everyone with his hilarious facial expression and his comical body movements. The crowd giggles into a fit of hysterics at Prince Dauntless&rsquo; child-like manner and they are lulled by the beautiful music from the chorus accompanied by the pit orchestra. The tornado happening behind the scenes is the show&rsquo;s best-kept secret as spectators praise our efforts to share this fantastic show.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the red velvet curtain descends on the final performance, melancholy fills the stage. Our seemingly endless journey has come to a close, but it&rsquo;s not totally over. The friendships we created offstage directly correlate to the energy and performance onstage, and they will last a lifetime. We stand side by side and join hands to take our final bow, which is fitting because from the start we faced this production as a single entity. With any theatrical production, there must be a sense of unity between the cast, crew, managers, directors, and choreographers because transferring a musical from page to stage is not an easy feat. Through theatre the barriers of age, grade, gender, reputation, and clique disappear. What&rsquo;s left is a tightknit group of students who genuinely care for each other. While the characters of <em>Once Upon A Mattress</em> have taken they&rsquo;re final bow, the magic of our newfound friendships will live happily ever after.

When the day arrives where kids become aware of the fact that it is actually possible to have a cute and cuddly friend in the house full-time, many parents are instantly skeptic.

Since last October, she has been volunteering at a local Japanese animal organization called &ldquo;Bow Meow Shanghai&rdquo;. Reiren started out as a volunteer, but she recently became more involved with the organization and inspired to plan an animal adoption day at the school&rsquo;s Gubei Campus. Here, she discusses her involvement with the organization and her ambitions to help others. </em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why did you start volunteering at Bow Meow Shanghai?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have been participating in the charity organization since October 2014 for my major Community, Service, and Action (CAS) project for my IB diploma. One of my teachers, Mr. Okada, first told me about the organization. I also have a dog of my own and this helped inspire me to get involved.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your role as a volunteer?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bow Meow Shanghai helps people adopt stray animals. I go to the adoption days held at <em>Laowai Jie</em> in Gubei every month. The stray animals are raised at the volunteers&rsquo; homes and they are brought to the adoption days to appeal to people who are looking to adopt a pet. My job there is to translate Chinese or English to Japanese (my native language) and to help the Japanese-group volunteers communicate with other people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With regard to other activities at YCIS, we have advertised our adoption days by posting signs around the school and holding a &ldquo;Free Dress Day&rdquo;, where students could come dressed in casual clothes rather than their uniforms if they made a contribution to support the organization. After the animal-themed Free Dress Day held in December, we were able to donate more than RMB 4000 to the volunteers of the organization. Most of the volunteers raise more than four dogs or cats at once so they have to spend a lot of time taking care of the animals, which also makes it costly. Therefore, this Free Dress Day was of great help for them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Your adoption day on May 17 was a great success in the community. How did you go about planning the event?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We were holding an adoption day once per month; however it didn&rsquo;t seem frequent enough. Our volunteers work very hard and some of our Japanese volunteers even foster animals for over a year. Therefore, we thought we would increase the number of adoption days in the hopes of getting more animals adopted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I discussed this idea with Mr. Okada, and we determined that it would be great if we could hold the event right outside of our campus gates. We target the international community for adoptions, and our campus is in a prime location in Gubei for international family pet adopters. I approached our Co-Principal, Dr. Swann, about the idea and he asked me to write a proposal. In my proposal, I was very clear about the purpose of the event and had logistics planned out, so our Co-Principals agreed that we could host the event at school. On the day of the event, we were all very happy with the turnout and adoption results.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your favorite part about volunteering at the organization?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have found my YCIS CAS project and supporting Bow Meow Shanghai to be to be very meaningful. This job gives me a great sense of accomplishment since I am able to help the volunteers. When a family or individual adopts the animals, we all feel very happy. I am glad that I&rsquo;ve had the chance to be part of the organization and I will continue to do my best to help the volunteers and animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is your biggest takeaway from the project? </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>We are ultimately helping animals, and that is very valuable. It&rsquo;s important for people to take responsibility for animals, and there are many out there that need help. I&rsquo;m glad that I can be part of this and I plan to continue to be involved. Next year, I am thinking about also being involved in the Environmental Club at YCIS and perhaps volunteer to plant trees. Although planting trees and helping animals are very different projects, they serve the same purpose of helping others, and that&rsquo;s what life is all about.&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '225', '1', '<p>Father&rsquo;s Day is on June 21 and it&rsquo;s about time to start thinking about gifts.

Without the crowds of people, careless taxi drivers and traffic congestion, riding a bicycle has many pros.

Luckily, there is a solution that lets you explore the city safely with your child. WeeRide is a company that offers safe bicycle solutions for families. WeeRide kangaroo is the number one best selling seat in UK and US. The seat can be attached between an adult bike seat and handlebar. This gives you better stability and lets you be able to bond with your child compared to seats that are mounted on the back. The Kangaroo bike seat allows you to chat with your child during the ride while experiencing the appealing view of the city with your child positioned in the front. This one comes in a regular and deluxe version, the latter featuring extra padding in the seat and headrest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For older kids, there is the WeeRide Co-Pilot, which is like a bicycle that, instead of having a front wheel, is attached to the parent&rsquo;s bike in the front. This helps the parents to keep control while biking. The bikes come in different varieties of colors pink, neon green and silver and works for kids that are too old for the Kangaroo. The Co-Pilot can easily be attached and detached from the parent&rsquo;s bicycle. The Co-Pilot uses a Sync Link pivot, which guarantees a smooth and safe ride for your kid.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// To order your own WeeRide, visit <a href=\"http://urbancoolkids.taobao.com\">urbancoolkids.taobao.com</a> or email info@weeridekids.com<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family:arial,verdana,sans-serif; font-size:14px\">&nbsp;</span></p>'), ('1', '1', '227', '1', '<p>Summer brings a lot of excitement to Shanghai. Whether you&rsquo;re leaving for good, have a child who&rsquo;s graduating school, or getting ready for a summer vacation; this time of year is all about chaotic last minute lunch dates and trips to the fake market (again&hellip;for the 5th time this week). This summer will be the longest time that I&rsquo;ve ever spent going back to Canada from Shanghai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will also be the longest time I&rsquo;ve ever been away from Ben AND the longest time that I&rsquo;ve ever had both of my kids all to myself. 7 weeks is a long time! I&rsquo;ve already told Ben that once he finally joins us at the 8 week mark that he better be bringing some kind of gift to me for the accomplishment of not having a complete mental breakdown or killing both of our children. I&rsquo;ve also told him to keep the receipt because if one of our kids just happens to be missing when he shows up we can exchange my gift down for something of a lesser value. Hey, one kid is still alive right? I mean&hellip; I should still get SOMETHING for that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So despite my incredible apprehension about the flight with both kids and knowing that I only have myself to blame about my extended single-mommyness, what is making me get through the sleepless nights is the sheer fact that I&rsquo;ll get to put so much good food in my belly when I get home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sure, I could sit here and tell you how much I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing my friends and family when I get home - and indeed I am - but let&rsquo;s face it, I&rsquo;m most excited about the food. If you reach deep down inside and think about it, you&rsquo;ll likely admit the same.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I&rsquo;ve spent the last 6 months of my life here working out and dropping 30lbs. All those salads and lean protein has been really great for my mind and body. But do you know what will be even better? Poutine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But not just any poutine, one topped with goat cheese and pulled pork because if you&rsquo;re going to do poutine you better make it snobby. For those of you who don&rsquo;t know what poutine is, it&rsquo;s a classic Canadian dish made from French fries topped with gravy and cheese curds (think lumpy bits of cheese). Sounds gross? We can&rsquo;t be friends.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also just so happen to live in the Greek part of my city which means many a delicious souvlaki will be had. My favorite place is worked at by a bunch of very surly yet well-meaning men. The last time I went in one guy took one look at me and screamed &ldquo;WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN!? WHAT IS THIS NEW BABY? YOU TELL ME LATER! WHAT DO YOU WANT? YOU CAN&rsquo;T ORDER COKE! PEPSI OR GET OUT!&rdquo; But I always gladly take the abuse for arguably the best souvlaki in Greek Town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And okay, I will be reaching for tons of fruits, veggies, and fish that I know for certain is not fished out of the dirty creek behind my compound. I&rsquo;ll eat all the things that are cheap, plentiful, and safe and won&rsquo;t cause my kids to break out in mystery rashes even though I know for a fact that they don&rsquo;t have food allergies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And fair food - the one food that I know I should never look forward too because it always ends up as a big ball of grease at the bottom of my belly.

Often perceived as a subject primarily focused on painting and drawing...&nbsp;Sculpture, Video Installation, Printmaking, Animation and Photography among many other media can be accessed throughout the program of study to express thoughts in a visual format.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Having joined The British International School Shanghai Pudong at the beginning of Year 12 from Norway (where Art and Design is not currently part of the everyday curriculum), Mari Hagen Stokke had little prior experience of traditional art making techniques when she joined us. With a great enthusiasm for the Arts and a long standing passion for, and participation in dance, Mari looked for ways to exploit her interests and play to her strengths within the parameters of the course.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whilst exploring the area of&nbsp;<em>Interpretations of Culture</em>, Mari chose to learn about video installation to create her piece&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Lg6Qqtdn3_I\"><strong><em>Safety in Numbers</em></strong></a>&nbsp;and to realise her developing interest in investigating the concept of &lsquo;<em>Movement&rsquo; and &lsquo;Displacement&rsquo;&nbsp;</em>as reoccurring themes throughout her body of artworks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excitement, curiosity, uncertainty and a desire to belong are common and natural feelings experienced by anybody moving to a new country, culture or social community. Being able to adapt, communicate and, in time, make new friends (even without a shared language!), through mutual respect and a willingness to find common ground are all part of the process of adjustment. In her video artwork Mari explores all of these emotions using dance as the metaphor for the process of acclimatisation and belonging. Set in Puxi&rsquo;s Fuxing Park in Shanghai,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Lg6Qqtdn3_I\"><strong><em>Safety in Numbers</em></strong></a>&nbsp;has a soundtrack of traditional Norwegian music to further highlight both the contrast and common ground within her own and the new culture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The courage and sensitivity with which Mari undertook this project embodies all of the characteristics of a successful IB Learner. Taking creative risks, being inquisitive and open minded about unknown cultures and customs, and learning new skills and art media to make accomplished outcomes.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/Lg6Qqtdn3_I\"><strong><em>Safety in Numbers</em></strong></a>&nbsp;is a celebration of&nbsp;<em>Displacement</em>&nbsp;through&nbsp;<em>Movement</em>, of broadening our minds through new experiences and social connections, of courage and of perseverance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At a time of year when many people are arriving or departing in Shanghai, this artwork is a respectful homage to embracing culture, both our own and others. It reminds us of the joy of being a Global Citizen, the thrill of new opportunities and the chance to make memories that will last a lifetime.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We look forward to seeing in which direction and in what form Mari takes her creative journey next year at The British International School Shanghai.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>View Mari&#39;s video art&nbsp;installation <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Lg6Qqtdn3_I\">here</a>.</p>'), ('1', '1', '233', '1', '<p>International kid favorite, Peppa Pig, is now hitting China where the show will be broadcasted on CCTV&rsquo;s children&rsquo;s channel, CCTV 14.

Here is a blog post from one of the students from Dulwich College, Courtney McAtee, telling us about a day as a volunteer building the orphanage.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Day 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started the day by leveling the ground beneath the swings. It was quite hard because we had to level it on a slant. Also, it was a warm day so we had to keep hydrated. To avoid turning the swing area into a mud pit in the rainy season, we were building a large 4 by 4 meter sandpit to surround the swing. We managed to level the ground, build edges so the sand wouldn&#39;t spill out and collect water to keep the soil underneath compact. For the edge of the sandpit we needed to collect large pieces of timber, each well over three meters long and quite thick. We carried the wood down the hill on our shoulders and then sawed it to the right size. It was a long day of physical labor, perhaps our longest so far. Some days we have not managed to see much difference in the land despite hours of work, which can be a little demoralizing, but today was quite satisfying as we could clearly see a huge difference with the land leveled and the new large sandbox surrounding the swings. It felt good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After finishing all that, we wanted the soil to stay in place so we had to collect some water to sprinkle onto the dusty soil before stamping it firmly down. Collecting water was the hardest part of my day. When I arrived at the water pipe loads of people were waiting to fill their jerry cans at the local standpipe, and seeing the long line it made me realize that this is a daily reality for so many people. After they filled it, they placed it on their head and walked off. This all looked simple until I tried it! I filled my 20 liter can and then shoved half a plantain (a hard, unripe savory banana) into the top to keep the water from spilling out. Most people would carry it on their heads, so I tried this first but it put a lot of strain on my neck and head so this method didn&#39;t last long. I then decided to try putting it on my shoulder, like how we had carried the wood earlier. I found that hard to balance as the water sloshed around so much inside the can that it was very destabilizing and would just slip off. In the end, I just carried it with my hands underneath the bottom of the can. 20 liters of water is about 20 kilos, so these cans were heavy! As if that wasn&#39;t hard enough we had to cross over streams, jump over gaps, climb up steep hills and go through people&#39;s back gardens and fields to carry it back home. From the water pipe to The Peace Centre is probably around a 1 kilometer walk, so it is safe to say that by the end I was exhausted. I can&#39;t imagine how people can do this every day all day, when all I have to do is turn on a tap to get water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Later on in the evening there was a talk at the Peace Centre children about human rights. Some of them knew they had a right to clean water, education and healthiness, but some of them seemed surprised to hear about it. Most of them would have come from backgrounds where they wouldn&#39;t go to school or have enough food each day. I see a lot of children around Bukinda who don&#39;t go to school but instead spend their days looking after cows and goats, or collecting water for their family. The Peace Centre children are lucky they now have access to clean water and lots of food every day, as well as an education, and I got the impression that they felt that tonight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The last thing we all did today was to help the children write to their sponsor families. I was with one of the youngest kids in TPC and he didn&#39;t fully understand the role of the sponsor yet, except that they are a person/family living far away who support him and want him to do well. He got his first letter from his sponsor today and he started to understand more about it. He calls his sponsor Tata (dad). Four children received their first communications from their sponsors tonight and especially for the ones who were a little older, it was pretty amazing witnessing their reactions to receiving this. The majority clearly does understand and appreciate the role of the sponsor: that of a long distance adoptive parent/family. Some of these children were just bubbling with excitement, and even crying tears of happiness when receiving these emails. If any sponsors are reading this blog, know how much of an impact your communications mean to these children. We all got to see the extreme joy and massive smiles first hand tonight and it was very special.&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '238', '1', '<p>By Shirley Wu</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teams from AKSIL (Active Kidz Shanghai International League) were hugely successful in the Shanghai International Youth Soccer League (SIYSL) 2014/15, picking up the championship prizes in the Division 1 competition for years U10, U12 and U14.&nbsp;AKSIL teams were also runners up for U10, U12 and U17, while AKSIL teams also won the Division 2 competition in U10 and U12 categories.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Competing against over 70 teams made up of local players and foreigner players from 11 different Shanghai-based clubs, AKSIL Head Coach Radfan Mahyoub expressed pleasure at the overall performance of all AKSIL teams who competed in the year-long SIYSL competition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;AKSIL has played in the SIYSL league since the beginning in 2006. It&rsquo;s the most important youth soccer tournament in Shanghai and for us to have gained 5 Championships plus numerous second and third places, is a huge victory for all the entire ASKSIL family.&rdquo; Coach Radfan, who also coached the successful U12 PX AKSIL team, said: &ldquo;As a Head Coach of AKSIL, I&rsquo;m proud to see the success we have achieved in the league, which in addition to winning tournaments in Shanghai, Beijing, Singapore and Thailand has made for another successful year for AKSIL. I am looking forward for next season and continuing this success.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proud AKSIL PX U10 championship winning coach Amine Hammadi stressed that while winning the SYISL league with a 13 wins, 1 lose record, and scoring 120 goals in the process, was very satisfying, it was the way his team played that made him most pleased. &ldquo;What&#39;s most important was the quick adaptation of the modern football style by a group of 10 years old boys who have been practicing together for the past three years on the AKSIL training field. I think everyone who watched them play admired the way they played especially for 10 year olds.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Coach Hammadi commented that the SYISL league gave his team an opportunity to play on a top quality pitch where they could practice a short and quick style of passing game. He also looked forward to more future competition and hoped more competitive local teams would join the league which would help AKSIL and all teams improve and also to give chance to local Chinese players to gain more experience playing European and western kids.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A strong focus on specialized trainings involving special drills for&nbsp;coordination, passing, shooting, dribbling as well as conditioning and team building were key reasons for the success of U12 PU, who came 2<sup>nd</sup> in the U12 D1, according to Coach Pawan Awan Singh. &ldquo;We run different types of games focusing on individual players as well as teamwork.&nbsp;&nbsp;Our team was new, made up of players from different teams, backgrounds and nationalities. It took some time&nbsp;for the players to know each other but&nbsp;by the end of the season we were a strong team will good bonding between players and coach. Our achievements this year were outstanding.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AKSIL also entered younger aged teams into the SIYSL league to prepare them for the next year. Coach Isaac Asare of AKSIL PX U9, who finished U10 D2 champions was pleased with his teams 12 wins, 1 tie and 1 lose record. &ldquo;Such an amazing performance was as a result of effective training drills, passion and determination from the players, strong commitment from both players and parents and support from parents on and off the field. In the coming year and the years ahead, it is my aim to train and develop these new young soccer players and together win trophies in SIYSL as well as other competitions&rdquo;, said Coach Issac.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Manager of the AKSIL PD U14 team, Kate Zak said that her two kids joined AKSIL two seasons ago when they moved to Shanghai in the 2013-2014 season. &ldquo;It has been an amazing season for players, Coaches and families. Playing with AKSIL requires tremendous commitment, effort and focus. The reward is the sense of satisfaction the teams have after each match played well. The year end results speak for themselves as all AKSIL teams finished strongly. The development of the individual players and growth as a team are impressive accomplishments - all involved should feel proud&rdquo;, said Ms Zak.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After four years as part of the AKSIL family, manager of U14 PX team Christian Kuhne will be returning to Germany this summer.&nbsp; He said that over his four years he was most pleased to have seen the improvements in skill and teamwork that the AKSIL players had established, and being part of AKSIL and playing in the SIYSL was a very worthwhile experience. &ldquo;I am very thankful for having had the opportunity to be the manager of my son&rsquo;s team, as I got the chance interact with new people and was able to support the team with a strong team-spirit! Parents supporting the players and coach have been major reasons for the<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>ir success&rdquo;, said Manager Kuhne.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>AKSIL was started by AKS (Active Kidz Shanghai) 12 years ago as a competitive soccer team and seeks to further nurture the development on children who have a passion, commitment and talent for soccer.&nbsp; Now with 16 teams spread over 5 different age groups, all competing in the SIYSL league, we are thrilled with the progress, achievements and results all teams have made.&nbsp; With 22 championships this past year, AKSIL has continued to grow and proven itself within youth soccer in Shanghai and Asia regionally&rdquo; stated Miia Kauppila, AKS General Manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more about AKS see: <a href=\"http://www.activekidz.org/\">www.activekidz.org</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For more about SIYSL see: <a href=\"http://www.siyslchina.org/\">www.siyslchina.org</a></p>'), ('1', '1', '239', '1', '<p>July 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Stepping Stones summer program</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Volunteer in migrant schools and community centers in Shanghai.

I bet you are! But don&rsquo;t worry &ndash; after all this rain is done Shanghai will turn into a terribly hot desert of sun and unbearable humidity. Gotta love summer!</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first summer in China was spent exclusively in Shanghai - mostly because I was 8 months pregnant and they wouldn&#39;t let me fly anymore. At first I thought it would be awesome, I mean, I&rsquo;ve been to Mexico and Cuba tons of times, I can take the heat&hellip; but no. No, Shanghai to me was a whole other beast. In fact, there was one day where I physically made my own swimming pool&hellip; out of sweat. Out of my own sweat. Before 11 in the morning. I was so hot, so hot, and pregnant, and sweaty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when I get that way the thing I like to do the most is swim. Funnily enough I have a slight phobia of public swimming pools. I&rsquo;m good if I have enough distractions, like when I take Oren to baby swimming and figure if I spend too much time thinking about what may be in the water that chances are I&rsquo;ll forget all about him and he&rsquo;ll end up at the bottom of the pool - so I have pretty good incentive to focus. But, if left to my own thoughts, suddenly the fun summer experience of being in a pool turns into my brain screaming with thoughts of: &ldquo;What is that guy doing? Did he just spit into the pool drain? Doesn&rsquo;t that thing just drain back into the pool!? Is that baby not wearing a diaper at all? OMG is that a hair on my arm!? IS THAT A HAIR ON MY ARM!? WHOSE HAIR IS IT!?!?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So sufficed to say it isn&#39;t enjoyable to me. It all stems from when I used to work in promotions and had to be at this water park a few weekends in a row. On break time my coworker and I would take a trip down the lazy river on our inner tubes and talk about how giving out stickers and standing around aimlessly was pretty much the best summer job ever. Then I vividly remember something brushing against and then clinging to my arm. I thought it must be a hair or something&hellip; but then I look up and ahead of me is a teenage girl running her fingers through her very long thick black hair and tossing it around while trying to display some sort of mating ritual to her boyfriend. I look at my arm and it wasn&#39;t a single hair, it was a CLUMP of hair. Like, as if she was shedding Chewbacca level clumps of matted hair. I ran out of the lazy river and into the wave pool instead, where surely there was no harm to be done there. I mean, a wave pool means a great filter system where any hair would be quickly swept away into the drainage system right?&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hair yes, maxi pads, no. As it lazily floated past my shoulder and threatened to actually make contact with my skin (gaaaaaauuuughhh!!!) I knew my time in public swimming pools was going to be limited for life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I was willing to make all the exceptions when I was pregnant and hot and burning like a furnace in the Shanghai heat. I got on the computer and started looking up water parks - which I can&rsquo;t make sense of to this day - but who can make sense of a pregnant lady&rsquo;s mind anyway right? I thought maybe Kai would like to splash around and all of the pictures of Maya Beach Water Park in Happy Valley looked super fun from the website. So I asked my driver about it and he pretty much had a heart attack saying I couldn&rsquo;t and shouldn&rsquo;t go. That made me want to go even more. I mean, who&rsquo;s gonna tell me I can&rsquo;t go to the water park and sit in a shallow kids&rsquo; pool that is 100% absolutely just urine? I found out later that he was so adamantly against me going not because I was pregnant (I apparently wouldn&#39;t have been granted entrance because of that fact anyway) but because going to a Shanghai water park was pretty much the equivalent of asking to be crammed into a Shanghai bus at peak rush hour but with water and way more people.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I Google imaged the park and saw pics of people almost shoulder to shoulder in the water; pictures where yellow inner tubes are not even floating as they are forming their own stagnant island that people could begin to turn into a civilization like in the movie&nbsp;<em>Water World</em>. I don&#39;t know if it&rsquo;s because the parks are only open a limited amount of time in the year, if it&rsquo;s just the sheer population of China, or if it&rsquo;s both. But it&rsquo;s probably both.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I bought myself&hellip; I mean the kids&hellip; a small blow up pool that I put into the back yard. I figured I&rsquo;d have the best of both worlds: a private place to cool off free from any outside contaminates of stranger hair or maxi pads.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And then Oren pooped in the pool.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summer ruined.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '241', '1', '<p>A few weeks ago, Urban Family hosted a fun cooking class at Raphael&#39;s at Shanghai Renaissance Yangtze Hotel.

Your child&rsquo;s teacher recommends that you spend time this summer working at home, but&hellip; how?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some &ldquo;Tips from a Teacher&rdquo; about how to get that extra review and practice at home this summer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TIP #1: Befriend Your Local Stationary Store</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t underestimate the power of a colorful writing utensil. Kids may not want to write their ABC&rsquo;s, spelling words or sentences over and over again, but add a highlighter to the mix and they&rsquo;ll be begging you to let them practice writing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My favorite part of China has got to be the abundance of fun, little school-supply shops. These shops are filled with colorful markers, highlighters, cartoon character pencils, stickers and - my students&rsquo; favorite - glitter pens. So be sure to stock up on fun writing supplies before your summer study.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TIP #2: Sight Word Jenga</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the things that teachers will often tell parents to do is to review &ldquo;sight words.&rdquo; These are the words that we see and use most often in English. They are the words that students need to memorize in order to read fluently, and to write basic sentences, and they a big part of any &ldquo;Summer Review&rdquo; list. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how can we practice reading these words? Flashcards are always an option, but that can be dull after a while, so I recommend Jenga. After all, who doesn&rsquo;t love the tower building game that requires dainty fingers and a big tumbling crash of blocks?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the aforementioned stationary stores, or online, you can buy a cheap set of plain Jenga blocks. Then, using a permanent marker, write each word your child needs to study on a block. Build the tower by putting three blocks facing one way, and three facing the other until it&rsquo;s nice and tall. Then carefully push and pull each block out. When your child has successfully pulled out a block, they read the word and get a point. If they can&rsquo;t read the word, it goes on top of the tower. The person with the most blocks when the tower comes crashing down, wins.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This game can be played with all age levels, and can also be used to practice alphabet recognition. Just write letters on the blocks instead of words. Great for pre-school level motor skills and all-around family fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TIP #3: Take It Outside</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a beautiful day and no one wants to focus on reviewing the alphabet - so take it outside! Go on an ABC scavenger hunt: take a walk around the neighborhood, looking for letters on street signs or in shop windows. Have your child cross off the letters they find on their walk, and reward them if they get through the whole alphabet. Remember: I is for ice cream.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TIP #4: Keep it Crafty</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Summer in Shanghai is bound to have some rainy days, so if you can&rsquo;t take a walk outside, there are ways to be creative indoors, too. Make an ABC Smash Book: buy a small notebook for your child and assign a letter or a word to each page. Have them search through old magazines, shopping bags, or other print materials to find letters and words to collage into their &ldquo;smash book.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>These pages can be supplemented with their own decorations as well, but ripping through old magazines is always fun. This activity can also be used to practice phonics by finding pictures of words that have the same sound as the letter you&rsquo;re looking for. Find a picture of an apple? Cut it out and glue it on the &ldquo;A&rdquo; page. Keep the search interesting by looking for both capital and lowercase letters, and by the end of the summer, they&rsquo;re bound to have one very cool looking book.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TIP #5: Use the Internet Like a Teacher</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a little secret&hellip; Teachers don&rsquo;t make all of their own resources. We use the Internet. Places like <a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/\">Pinterest</a>, <a href=\"https://www.teacherspayteachers.com/\">TeachersPayTeachers</a> and <a href=\"http://www.education.com/\">Education.com</a> are all websites I visit on a daily basis to get ideas for games, crafts and materials. You can use these websites too, and a lot of great resources are free. Both Education.com and TeachersPayTeachers have free, colorful flashcards and worksheets waiting for you to print out and practice with your child.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using the Internet like a teacher will make your summer studying easier and more efficient, so be sure to check these sites out.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Teachers, parents and students all look forward to relaxing, fun summers. But many students lose important information during the summer, which means that your child will be playing catch-up when they go back to school in September.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reviewing and reading a little bit everyday this summer will make a big difference, and these tips will help make it all more fun. Enjoy your summer holidays, anchor and happy studying!</p>');

Whether it&rsquo;s to get rid of those dark circles around your eyes that make you cringe in front of the mirror, or you just need some time to spoil yourself, a visit to the spa can do wonders. We tried out these three treatments, and must say we feel pretty refreshed.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Express Discovery Treatment at Dragonfly Spa</strong><br />\r\nEven the busiest of high fliers or super-moms can justify taking 45 minutes out for an express facial at Dragonfly in the IFC Mall in Lujiazui. The only branch of the popular Shanghai spa that offers this particular treatment, Dragonfly are targeting time-poor customers in need of a luxurious burst of rejuvenation and relaxation. The Valmont skincare products used for this facial come from Switzerland and contain glacial spring water and extracts from plants grown in the brand&rsquo;s own garden in the Swiss Alps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Greeted at the spa by Dragonfly&rsquo;s welcoming team, we were immediately shown to their relaxing treatment room and given slippers and a robe. With glass baubles dangling from the ceiling, low lighting and soft, relaxing music we instantly felt the stress of the day slip away.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The therapist tied back our hair and gave our shoulders a much needed rub and then set about cleaning our skin. After gently removing our make-up, our skin was exfoliated with a micro-granule cream and wiped away with a warm cloth. After this, two moisturizing masks were applied, both carrying delicious scents, and we were transported to a place far away from Shanghai. We then had a gentle serum rubbed over our face which sealed in all the goodness of the Valmont products.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treatment, which felt much longer than 45 minutes, finished with a fantastic head rub focusing on the scalp and then a gentle face massage. We left the spa feeling much lighter on our feet and our skin was soft as a peach, with a light glow. We highly recommend this treatment for anyone in need of some pampering who works or lives in close proximity to the IFC Mall.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// RMB760 for 45 minutes, Dragonfly Spa, LG2-47, 8 Shiji Da Dao, by LujiazuiHuan Lu 世纪大道8号1楼, 近陆家嘴环路(6878 5008)</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Glowing and Lifting Magnetic Treatment at Diva Life</strong><br />\r\nThis treatment is done using the magnetic anti-aging machine ISO 9001. We tried it at Diva Life Beauty Lounge and as promised, there was an instant change in the structure and feel of ourskin.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lying down on a bed, a metal plate was placed under ourlower back. A stick connected to the machine was run over our face for 45 minutes, using a magnetic pulse to heat our inner skin. The procedure stimulates the skin&rsquo;s collagen, so they say, which creates new cells, washes away toxins and increases metabolism.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We started with the left side of the face,and then took a break to see what difference the procedure makes.There was a slight but noticeable difference in the firmness of our skin compared to the untreated side. The machine may look a bit intimidating, and your face feels very warm from the magnetic pulses, but it&rsquo;s definitely not painful. We even fell asleep for a few minutes during the treatment. Afterwards, our face felt firmer and had a nice glow.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>More than one treatment is needed for lasting results, but it certainly has an effect on tired and loose skin. After a few treatments, the results can allegedly last for up to a year. Before and after the magnetic treatment, you also get a good cleanse, moisturizing and a bit of facial massage usingDermalogica products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diva Life Spa is located in a quiet lane on RuijinEr Lu and the slightly kitschy setting is quite nice and relaxing. The staff is very friendly and there is a large selection of beauty treatments, from traditional facial treatments and waxingsto lash/brow care and manicures. It&rsquo;s a great place to go and get all your superficial needs taken care of in one day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Exclusively to Urban Family readers, Diva Life is now offering a 50 percent discount for the first treatment, which means you pay only RMB500 (original price RMB1,000/45 minutes) and for 8 treatments you pay only RMB3,000 (instead of RMB8,000).

Located across the street from the R&eacute;el Mall, this spa is fresh, modern and bright, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable. All facial treatments at this spa start with a relaxing ten minutes of hot stone massage on your back and shoulders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After some cleansing and massaging, we started with a deep pore cleansing. This was not your regular steam-and-squeeze routine. High tech equipment is used to effectively remove dirt, blackheads and dead skin. Even though the noise and feel of the pore cleansing gadget wasn&rsquo;t the most pleasant, this machine proved to be quite effective. On some spots such as around our nose wings, it felt slightly uncomfortable because this area was given some extra attention.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After the cleanse, we moved onto the oxygen treatment. Another high tech machine was rolled in and an oxygen mist was sprayed all over our face. Although it sometimes felt strange to breathe in the mist, the treatment was comfortable- it is mainly done for the result, not for the experience.However, we finished off with a mask and a blissful head and shoulder rub and walked out relaxed and rejuvenated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The result of this treatment was really positive. Many of us know how refreshing it can feel to get a deep pore cleanse, but the oxygen treatment was a total surprise. With celebrity fans such as Madonna, this treatment has become successful for obtaining a younger lookand it is not difficult to imagine why. Although it takes regular upkeep, there is an immediate refreshing effect and it gives you that glow that you might wish to obtain before an important event or when you just want to look extra good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// 3/F, 88 Tongren Lu, by Yanan Xi Lu铜仁路88号一层, 近延安西路 (<a href=\"http://www.zeta-spa.com/\">www.zeta-spa.com</a>)<br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '246', '1', '<p>Yoga and Pilates can offer the ideal way to zone out from the stresses of family life, but what about those people looking for something a little more than the average neighborhood studio?

The car has a built in child seat in the place of an actual seat that swivels to the side to allow for easy access, and that also swivels to the back so that you can stare lovingly into your spawns eyes as it vomits all over itself. It also has a built in bottle warmer and under seat storage for extra blankets and a hairbrush (as seen in the video - why?). Sounds great right? Why wouldn&#39;t anyone love this marvel of modern expensive technology built around our beloved offspring?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well the major problem people have with the concept is that the baby seat is located in the front passenger seat section of the car. Although in Europe it can be quite common to see a baby seat in the front rear-facing with the airbag switched off, there is a lot of debate over the safety of it all. There is also a lot of discussion on what about if you have twins? What about when the baby gets too big for the built-in seat?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To this I say: well obviously pick a favorite and then when they get too big simply tether them to the roof with bungee cords bought from Taobao!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But you know what? I say if you have the means to buy a car that caters solely to doe-eyed parents with their precious first borns, and obviously the chick in the promo picture has the means since she&#39;s clearly going grocery shopping with the family in evening gowns; then they should definitely buy that car. In fact, if Volvo were to market and sell their car solely in China I&rsquo;d be totally okay with that! I mean, if it looks cool then maybe we&#39;ll actually see more car seats being used instead of none at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When I first moved here and put my car seat in the car my driver looked at me like I was a super crazy person. He had no idea how to do up the buckles or even really how to sit Kai in it. At first I thought his inexperience was due only to the fact that he had no children of his own yet until I realized that car seat safety just isn&#39;t a thing in China. And I&#39;ll never understand why considering in my first two months living in shanghai I saw two (yes two) deaths related to vehicle accidents. Once when I was on the highway I even saw a driver with their toddler sitting on their lap - IN the driver&rsquo;s seat!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&#39;m not one to get all preachy about vehicle safety, I was raised in one of those old cars (ok not literally raised in it&hellip; sometimes I was kept in a box... but that&#39;s another story) where you sit on the front seat hump and seat belts just didn&#39;t exist. Cup holders? YOU were the cup holder! And when I finally did get shunned to the back seat (too many mishandled cups) it just wasn&#39;t an issue that the seatbelt clips were locked from underuse and sticky from some sort of orange marmalade concoction smeared in them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, in a city where there are so many cars, so many accidents, so much traffic, and so many occurrences of &ldquo;why the heck did you just come full stop in the middle of the highway!?&rdquo; you would think that people would not only be putting their kids in car seats but also taping an additional car seat on top of that one to create a protective cocoon of car safety.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So let&rsquo;s hope that Volvo does actually make that concept car and that maybe we&rsquo;ll see it on the streets of Shanghai. Because even questionable front seat car seats are better than arms acting as seatbelts, right? Cause if your arms are the seatbelts, who&rsquo;s gonna take all the cute baby photos of projectile vomiting in the car?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '248', '1', '<p><em>Submitted by YCIS Shanghai</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Betty Chan Po-king, Director and School Supervisor of Yew Chung International School (YCIS), one of the leading international school networks in China and Hong Kong, has been awarded honorary degrees on three continents &ndash; North America, Asia, and now Europe. Dr. Chan, a highly inspirational and innovative Hong Kong educator, collected her third continental award this month &ndash; an Honorary Degree of Doctor of Laws at the University of Bath, in England.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Honorary degrees are the most prestigious accolade granted by the University of Bath, reserved only for &ldquo;individuals of conspicuous merit&rdquo;. The university recently recognised Dr. Chan for her distinguished career focused on developing and promoting early childhood education, with equal emphasis on supporting greater understanding between East and West and between those of different cultural backgrounds. Links between Dr. Chan and the University of Bath arose from the shared interest in international education, and have existed for more than the past 15 years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Previously, Dr. Chan was awarded an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2010 from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) in the US for her pioneering work in early childhood education and for her consistent advocacy for excellence in global education. She was the first Chinese woman honored by UIUC in the field of early childhood education, and for her founding concept of the blend of Eastern and Western cultures to culminate in a true international model of education. Dr. Chan received her second Honorary Degree in 2014 with an Honorary Fellowship from the Hong Kong Institute of Education in recognition of both her recent and long-standing contribution to education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since assuming leadership of the Yew Chung Education Foundation which was founded by her mother, Madam Tsang Chor-hang, more than 80 years ago, Dr. Chan has developed Yew Chung schools in Hong Kong, Shanghai, Beijing, Chongqing, Qingdao, and Silicon Valley in the US. She has also been acknowledged for her advocacy of and contribution to the best practices of both East and West in education through government positions she has held and international conferences she has organized.

When you enter through the door of the Paw Pals Animal Rescue (PPAR) shelter, you are instantly greeted by about ten cats, caged or walking free, and they all look healthy and happy. On the floor above, the rest of the &ldquo;adoptable&rdquo; cats are resting in their cages and looking curiously at us when we enter the room. Some of them reach out their paws between the bars, as if to invite us to come and play with them. Some are marked by a few small imperfections such minor scars or red and teary eyes. All of them start to purr instantly when we open the cages to pick them up. Continuing to the third floor, however, the situation changes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before entering the rooms on the third floor, we wash our hands with soap and water. Some of the cats here are extremely sensitive and vulnerable to infections. One of them has a serious skin condition and is wearing a sweater over an almost bare body. His face is full of furless patches and strange liquids are coming out of the eyes, nose and mouth. In a cage next to him, a cat is staring into space and does not seem to notice our presence. Valentina, a volunteer at the shelter, tells me that they think he has FIV, a virus similar to AIDS in humans. &ldquo;These cats will never be adopted&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Only a person who is really willing to sacrifice a huge amount of time and energy would take home such a cat.&rdquo; The two rooms are filled with cats that are seriously injured or infected, and it is not difficult to imagine that many visitors limit their choices to the cats on the first and second floors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We talked to Valentina, a part-time volunteer at the PPAR Shelter about her experiences there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: What happens if a cat doesn&rsquo;t get adopted?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>He will stay here forever, I think.

Since I moved to Shanghai, I haven&rsquo;t been able to get a pet because I go back to Italy for months at a time. I decided that I needed to have cats in my life so I searched online for volunteering opportunities.

I tell myself every time I go here that I shouldn&rsquo;t get attached because I know I can&rsquo;t take them home with me. I always wanted to be a veterinarian, but life lead me in a different direction. Volunteering is a good way for me to live out that fantasy of working with animals, and I don&rsquo;t care about not getting paid for it. The reward of helping cats and spending some time with them, even for a few hours per week, is enough. I love all animals &ndash; not only cats &ndash; and I am a vegetarian.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: How often do you come here, and what do you do when you&rsquo;re here?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I usually come every Sunday if I can and I stay for about four hours. I sweep the floors, feed the cats, play with them and pet them. The social interaction with the cats is a very important aspect because we need to prepare them for adoption. If a cat is not friendly, the chances to find him or her a permanent home are very slim. The ayis&rsquo; who work here are really good at what they do and treat all the cats with great care. They make sure the cats get the food, medication and love they need, but of course it would be better for them to find permanent homes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: Do you have a special bond with any of the animals here?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, I have a favorite, Wu Song. He is big and orange &ndash; I love fat cats! He has become a bit of a mascot here at the shelter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: Are you worried about him?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think he will find a good home eventually. He is such a friendly cat that I couldn&rsquo;t imagine why nobody would take him. If not, I know that everyone at the shelter will take good care of him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: What has volunteering given you?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I like the fact that I am devoting some of my time to a good cause. I have been volunteering for about three years in total and about three months at this shelter. I think everyone should try to find what they are passionate about and help out in some way. I care about animals and I like to help them by coming here while others may be passionate about helping children, for example. Then they should find a good charity organization or try to help in some other way. Working at the cat shelter is also a great chance for me to practice my Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: What difficulties do you face as a volunteer?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s always difficult to see cats suffer and it&rsquo;s hard for me to accept that I can&rsquo;t adopt them. In Italy, I volunteered for WWF and helped save wild animals, and some of them died while I was taking care of them. It was especially difficult when they seemed to be recovering and doing well, and then got worse again. I haven&rsquo;t worked at this shelter for very long, but one event that shocked me was when they had to perform an abortion on a pregnant cat. I know it was for the best, and it&rsquo;s common to sterilize cats to control the birth rate, but a kitten abortion was difficult to take in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: What has been a happy moment during your time here?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just being around cats makes me happy and seeing them find a good home is always a great pleasure. I also have to add that it makes me happy to see how some people care for animals here in China. In a lot of other countries - at least in Italy &ndash; people generally think that nobody cares about animals and that the Chinese will eat anything that moves. But working here has made me realize what a deep love and respect a lot of people have for animals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>UF: How can people help?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Do what I did: just contact PPAR and offer to volunteer or adopt a cat if you can. I have no experience in working professionally with animals; all that was needed was a love for cats. As long as you are prepared to do things like sweep the floors and clean the cages, you can become a volunteer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// For more information about PPAR and how to become a volunteer, adopter or foster parent, email PPAR at <a href=\"mailto:ppar_sh@163.com\">ppar_sh@163.com</a> (English and Chinese) or call 021-5480-1699 (only in Chinese).

Whether romantic love has existed for only a handful of centuries or since the dawn of man, humanity has wasted little time pouncing upon love as a central and crucial human emotion. John Lennon believed it was all we needed to function as a society and William Wordsworth ushered in an entire genre of literature musing upon it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The question, of course, is why do we love? Would not Romeo and Juliet&rsquo;s lives have been simpler had they not suffered from the paralyzing and agonizing cognitive responses the emotion brings?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It turns out that we have little choice in the matter: humans are biologically predisposed to love. Evolutionary biologists believe that the emotion of love evolved as an advantageous trait due to pair bonding resulting in a greater percentage rate of survival for offspring. Swans are famous for their pair bonding and co-rearing of offspring. However, the most studied animal in this regard is the prairie vole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only do prairie voles pair bond, but they also engage in more sex than is biologically necessary &ndash; that means prairie voles have sex for fun. The correlation between the prairie voles&rsquo; monogamy and their healthy sex life led researchers to look more closely at two hormones released in both prairie voles and humans during orgasm: vasopressin and oxytocin. It turns out that when prairie voles are given a drug that suppresses the release of vasopressin, they show disinterest in their mate and fail to protect her or him from new mates. In short, it seems they fall out of love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The second love hormone, oxytocin, is likely the most researched hormone in the world right now and scientists have discovered that it is released during human touch, orgasm and even during breastfeeding in both mother and child. The role of the hormone is clear: oxytocin is our natural love drug.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Psychology professor Ruth Feldman of Bar-Ilan University in Israel has been conducting research on oxytocin and its role in human relationships for years. Her recent studies focus on the role of oxytocin in relationships.&nbsp; Her research involves inviting couples at various stages of their &ldquo;love&rdquo; into her lab for testing. She found that, &ldquo;The increase in oxytocin during the period of falling in love was the highest that we ever found,&rdquo; referencing a study she and her colleagues recently published in the journal&nbsp;<em>Psychoneuroendocrinology</em>. The study also found that new lovers had double the amount of oxytocin that Feldman usually sees in pregnant women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Feldman also found that couples with the highest levels of oxytocin were the ones still together six months later and displayed higher levels of attunement to one another during a discussion of shared experiences.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Professor Helen Fisher of Rutgers is perhaps the most famous of all the love researchers due to her immensely popular TED Talk on the subject. She has utilized fMRI technology to investigate the variance of neurotransmitters among singles, new couples, friends and couples who have been together a long time. What she found was that newly in love couples situated in the &ldquo;attraction&rdquo; phase of love have extremely high levels of dopamine in each other&rsquo;s presence. In fact, the brain&rsquo;s reaction resembled that of someone under the influence of cocaine!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus when a relationship is suddenly cut off during this phase, it&rsquo;s as if a drug addict were attempting to kick their cocaine habit cold turkey. Our body literally goes into withdrawal. This is why Romeo would rather die than live without Juliet. It&rsquo;s why we stay up all night talking on the phone to a new girlfriend in spite of the early morning alarm; it&rsquo;s why we travel across the world to spend 36 hours with our new love. Love is a drug, and we are all capable&nbsp;and willing addicts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Matt Kuykendall teaches IB and AP psychology at Shanghai American School and is the proud father of Talia, 5 and Kieran, 3.&nbsp;</em></p>'), ('1', '1', '253', '1', '<p><em>By David Goodwin</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As an experienced school inspector, having worked for a number of school accreditation teams, I have learned that one of the issues I am most likely to end up commenting on in a school inspection report will be issues regarding transition and continuity of learning throughout the school period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents tend to be concerned about transition between schools or post school graduation into higher education. However, one of the biggest limiting factors in a child&rsquo;s academic progress is often the lack of continuity and progression in a school&rsquo;s curriculum planning and in the standardization of expectations and procedures in place across the classrooms of a single school.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A school can be full of very good teachers, with very good individual policies in place for their classroom, all who are providing very good individual lesson plans, but unless this ties together as one coherent whole school curriculum and a common set of expectations, then a child may as well be moving schools every single year, or even every single lesson if it&rsquo;s in the secondary phase, where students can often have up to ten different teachers involved in their education.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We often view children as adaptable beings, and in reality they are often far more adaptable than us adults. It&rsquo;s often the mums and dads that will suffer the biggest culture shock moving city or country and not the children. But with that said, it still takes children time to adapt, especially when it involves new methods of learning, new expectations from others and new boundaries within which they can work. Continuity and progression within a school is therefore essential for effective learning.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When looking for a new school for your children, there are a few things to consider in order to make sure that the education system is consistent and reliable:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>If your family moves around a lot, try to pick schools of one specific curriculum, for example British, American or French etc. This makes past and future transitions easier as the academic standards and the curriculum are set by the government. What is being studied in a British school in Shanghai for example, is likely to be 95% the same as that being studied in a British school back in London UK.</li>\r\n	<li>Consider a school of mixed ages. Having students from age 2 to age 18 on the same campus also means that the school naturally evolves as a whole organism with no obvious &lsquo;graduation&rsquo; from primary to secondary etc. Teachers of mixed age school often work with different classes and levels, which makes the education more consistent and the transition between different years more seamless.</li>\r\n	<li>Don&rsquo;t go too big. In a small or medium sized school, communication between teachers in different areas of the school is sometimes stronger. It also ensures that all teachers know all the children really well, so children with specific challenges or specific talents are known school-wide and their needs therefore better catered to across the curriculum and as they move through the school.</li>\r\n</ul>'), ('1', '1', '254', '1', '<p>Vacation season is here, and few places in the world offer as many stunning locations as the Philippines. In this issue of <em>Urban Family</em>, Classic Travel presents the first of a two-part travel feature about the country, starting with three top destinations on the beautiful island of Palawan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Palawan</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to many travelers, Palawan is the best destination in the Philippines. The island is often referred to as &ldquo;the last frontier of the Philippines&rdquo; due to its raw and underdeveloped paradise-like nature. If you are looking for a vacation in a place with out-of-this-world beauty (and who isn&rsquo;t?) the island&rsquo;s jungles, hidden beaches, lagoons and coral reefs will do the trick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The island makes a perfect destination for a relaxing family vacation without the hustle and bustle of some of the busier party islands in the Philippines, and it has repeatedly been voted the No. 1 island in the world by travel magazines and websites for its unspoiled beauty. Classic Travel recommends these destinations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Puerto Princesa</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The capital of Palawan, Puerto Princesa, has been named the cleanest and greenest city in the Philippines, and serves as a great starting point for discovering all the nearby wildlife and attractions. The city is a multicultural melting pot with a population from all over the Philippines and other countries. Locals will often tell you about the <em>kambak-kambak</em> (come back, come back) syndrome &ndash; the way visitors are drawn to come back to the city again and again.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The island&rsquo;s nature doesn&rsquo;t disappoint, with picture-perfect views and wildlife reserves. Activities such as scuba diving, wind surfing and dolphin watching are available either within the area of the city or a short boat ride away. The city offers a wide range of restaurants and bars, and the slow, relaxed pace of life in the city won&rsquo;t interfere with your vacation vibe. These are only a few of the great attractions of Puerto Princesa:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Underground River &ndash; Also known as the Subterranean River National Park, this attraction can be accessed by boat and offers spectacular limestone formations inside a cave.</li>\r\n	<li>Honda Bay &ndash; This beach can be reached within an hour from the city center and is well worth a visit if you&rsquo;re interested in perfect, unspoiled beaches.</li>\r\n	<li>Swimming with dolphins and whale sharks &ndash; There are several opportunities for these memorable experiences if you are staying in Puerto Princesa.</li>\r\n	<li>Plaza Cuartel &ndash; Take a break from the sun and visit the memorial site for all the Americans who were killed in Puerto Princesa during World War II.</li>\r\n	<li>Ugong Rock &ndash; Climb the mountain and zip line your way down again; this is a cool experience and can be done even if you are not an experienced rock climber.</li>\r\n	<li>Iwahig River &ndash; Go for a peaceful paddle down the river while watching millions of glowing fireflies.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>When to go:</strong> The weather is generally good all year round with few typhoons; the dry season is between November and June.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How to get there: </strong>Philippine Airlines, Cebu Pacific, Air Philippines and Zest Air&nbsp;all have daily flights taking about an hour from&nbsp;<a href=\"http://wikitravel.org/en/Manila\" title=\"Manila\">Manila</a>&nbsp;to Puerto Princesa.

The 45 islands and islets of the archipelago are best discovered by island hopping and kayaking. Hidden lagoons, magical seascapes and stunning limestone cliff backdrops (similar to the ones found in Guilin) create true magic in a way only nature can.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although the beachfront area of El Nido has increased in population and is now mainly a party area crowded with tourists, bars and restaurants, it serves as a great spot to stay while discovering the surrounding sea and archipelago by day.

At the bottom of the ocean you can find around a dozen well-preserved wrecks surrounded with coral reef, including a Japanese fleet from World War II. For the less adventurous, there are a number of islands with untouched beaches and crystal lagoons which are spectacular to visit by kayak. Coron is home to the beautiful Kayangan Lake which is famous for being the cleanest lake in the Philippines. The island itself has a number of tiny bright white beaches that are perfect for relaxed sunbathing for families.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The island is managed by an indigenous tribe which keeps a sustainable environment and a calm atmosphere.

Scared? Angry? Hopeless?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I feel scared and angry, but I have hope. The Chinese government has become more determined to ensure food safety. While things are happening at the governmental level in terms of new legislation and law enforcement, there are small things we individuals can and should do to improve food safety. We can read food labels, we can talk to the people we buy our food from, we can pay visits to the local farms that supply the stores where we do our grocery shopping.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, nothing can provide us more perspective than actually participating in the growing of food. This is a wonderful idea, but it&rsquo;s also a very luxurious dream for people living in an urban area like Shanghai. However, non-profit organizations such as GoodtoChina and Roots and Shoots have established farms in the city to provide land for people who want to grow their own fruits and vegetables. As a regular volunteer at one of GoodtoChina&rsquo;s urban farms, I encourage people to drop by and see what&rsquo;s growing in the farm. Roots and Shoots has also built several farms in schools to teach young kids about how foods are produced and to show them how to live sustainably.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The scarcity of land also doesn&rsquo;t stop creative and resourceful individuals, who create spaces in their homes or on their balconies for farming. This embodies the concept of &ldquo;0 miles&rdquo; (zero distance between the farm and the dining table). Most balcony farms follow traditional practices, using soil to grow vegetables and fruits in clay pots or even in wooden, Styrofoam or plastic boxes. In fact, all the materials needed to set up a balcony farm can be easily purchased from Taobao.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For people who have the DIY spirit and prefer a cleaner, laborsaving method of farming at home, window farming is a great option. I have been working on a vertical hydroponic farming system in my own apartment, using recycled materials, including water bottles and cardboard boxes. This system requires very little of the surroundings; a window with sunlight is enough. Furthermore, its vertical design allows it to take up very little space. Plants grow in clay balls, not soil, in this hydroponic system; therefore, there are minimal concerns about plant diseases associated with soil. Water with added nutrients is pumped to a high place, and then trickles down due to gravity, nourishing the plants along the way. Since nutrients are easily accessed by the plants, the plants can grow faster and have a shorter growing cycle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Admittedly, the harvest from these small-scale farming practices is not enough to meet the demand of the prospective grower, but it provides a solid foundation to establish communities, as farming creates a fundamental connection between people. It educates people about a lifestyle that is in harmony with nature and raises people&rsquo;s awareness that safe and high-quality foods should be a guarantee, not a luxury. These people are then more likely to take action to ensure that the government, food manufacturers and the local community work together to elevate food production standards and protect the environment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Ben Xie is a Registered Dietitian Nutritionist trained and certified in the US and currently works at JJ-Premier Medical Care (<a href=\"mailto:Benjamin.xie7@live.com\">Benjamin.xie7@live.com</a>, 18301949541)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Check out GoodToChina&rsquo;s farming projects at <a href=\"http://www.goodtochina.com/\">www.goodtochina.com</a>, and Roots and Shoots at <a href=\"http://www.jgi-shanghai.org/\">www.jgi-shanghai.org</a></p>'), ('1', '1', '257', '1', '<p><em>By Magdalena Skalkowska</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This easy to make, five-step salad mixes your favorite nuts with creamy avocado and rich eggs.

As a proud owner of two four-legged, furry friends, I have experienced firsthand the positive impact that my dogs have had on making my family&rsquo;s apartment a warm and welcoming place to come home to at the end of the day. Pets have the ability to provide us with companionship on lonely days, they help to get us off the couch and out on the running trail, not to mention how they can offer us invaluable lessons about how to nurture and care for ourselves and one another. In addition to these benefits, fascinating new research in the domain of cognitive neuroscience suggests that owning a pet can have a profound effect on the actual biochemical makeup of our brains.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>W</strong><strong>hat the Research Tells Us</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dr. Rebecca Johnson and her team of researchers at the University of Missouri-Columbia Center for the Study of Animal Wellness have conducted multiple studies that suggest how physical interactions with our pets - petting, hugging, kissing, cuddling &ndash; help to promote the release of chemicals in our brain that can, in turn, elevate our mood and ward off feelings of anxiety or depression. Dr. Johnson states, &ldquo;Our preliminary results indicate that levels of serotonin, a hormone in humans that fights depression, rises dramatically after interactions with live animals, specifically dogs. This hormone is critical to the psychological wellbeing of an individual.&rdquo; She goes on to identify how another naturally produced &ldquo;feel good&rdquo; hormone in the human brain, oxytocin, also experiences a spike in production as a result of our interactions with pets. &ldquo;This is very beneficial for us, as oxytocin helps us to feel happy and trusting,&rdquo; notes Dr. Johnson. Thus, while the researchers go on to acknowledge that there is no substitute for positive, nurturing, human-to-human relationships, owning a pet might be the next best thing for both your physical and mental health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>T</strong><strong>hings to Consider Before Making the Decision to Own a Pet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it the right time for me?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A positive pet-owner relationship can best be promoted in the context of a stable and settled home environment. If you are in the midst of any major life transitions &mdash; e.g. moving across the country, starting a new job, expecting a baby &mdash; then perhaps it would be in the best interest of both you and your future pet to delay the process until the timing is better suited for owning a pet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it the right cost for me?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whether you&rsquo;re pursuing an adoption or purchasing from a breeder, owning a pet can get expensive. Between food, shelter, regular and unanticipated trips to the veterinarian, toys, treats and grooming expenses, the costs of owning a pet will add up quickly. Take the time to do the research to determine the average annual costs of owning a pet of your choosing, and see how well it fits into your current budget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Does it fit with my lifestyle?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Determining if a pet will fit your lifestyle requires careful consideration of a number of factors. Does your work and travel schedule allow for you to own and care for your pet? Is your apartment complex or your neighborhood pet-friendly? Does your life&rsquo;s general structure and routine have room to incorporate caring for a pet? As we have highlighted, while there are innumerable benefits to owning a pet, the costs that come with it are a reality that one will have to consider before making the decision to welcome a pet into the home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// Dr. Nate Balfanz is the Senior Clinical Psychologist at JJ-Premier Medical Care, a comprehensive mental and medical health service clinic for expat children, adolescents, adults and families living in Shanghai.

Learning from previous mistakes such as not offering enough wine on the menus at Disneyland Paris or making the theme park space too small in Hong Kong, the Shanghai branch is planning to cater to local needs and requirements. For example, Chinese culture will be an apparent theme that will be combined with classic Disney concepts. Remy, the rat from Ratatouille will symbolize the Year of the Rat and during the Year of the Sheep, the lambs of Mary Poppins will do the same. A traditional Chinese garden, Dim Sum and other Chinese treats and a giant glass peony blossom representing nobility and good fortune&nbsp;are some of the features that will bring Disney closer to mainland customs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There is also a practical aspect to take into consideration. The one child policy and the fact that Chinese families like to travel together (especially during public holidays) with as many as four adults per child requires a heavy boost in the seating area department. Parks and gardens within the resort will therefore be larger than the ones of international counterparts and offering more areas for strolling as well as benches where elderly family members can relax while kids are enjoying the rides. Different types of food will also be offered at different price ranges.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another, perhaps not very flattering, analysis has brought up the issue of the Chinese tendency for line-cutting. One suggestion for a solution is to install single lane fences to keep lines organized and prevent the concept of &ldquo;constant walking&rdquo; as defined by a 2010 article in InPark Magazine, outlining the concept of slowly moving forward, ignoring the fact that there is a line ahead of you. The same magazine also pointed out the method of using your kid as an &ldquo;advance man&rdquo;, letting him or her bypass the waiting people as a socially accepted excuse to cut waiting times.</p>');

Thus, it should come as no surprise that researchers are now turning their interests towards better understanding how the food we put into our bodies has an influence, whether it be positive or negative, on the manner by which our mind functions. In my role as a child and family-focused practitioner here in Shanghai, I&rsquo;m inspired by the number of parents I have met who are motivated to promote healthy lifestyle habits for their children. The research noted in the current article helps to highlight just to what extent diet and children&rsquo;s mental health may be interrelated. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What the Research Tells Us</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In October of 2014, the American Journal of Public Health published an article by Dr. Adrienne O&rsquo;Neill and her colleagues reviewing 12 psychological studies focusing on the relationship between diet quality and the mental health status of children and adolescents. Initially, the results were mixed with regards to whether an unhealthy diet at a young age led to the development of mental health-related symptoms, or whether children with mental health-related symptoms consumed an excess amount of food as a form of self-medication. With that being said, the findings would also suggest that there is an inverse relationship between depressive disorders observed in children and diets high in folate, zinc, and magnesium, as well as an inverse relationship between omega-3 fatty acids and childhood-onset anxiety disorders. While we might question the strength of the association between these two sets of variables if it were found in a single research study, a meta-analysis review like the one conducted by Dr. O&rsquo;Neill helps to support the likelihood that a vitamin-rich diet and optimal mental health go hand-in-hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Tips to Consider for a Mental Health-Conscious Diet</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Monitor your child&rsquo;s eating habits. The DSM-V notes that fluctuations in your child&rsquo;s eating habits can sometimes be considered a symptom of a more significant mental health-related issue. In addition to the two major eating-related disorders of anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa, depressive and anxiety-related disorders will also often list fluctuations in eating habits as a common core symptom. If you begin to observe a noticeable shift in your child&rsquo;s daily food intake, it may be worth considering a trip to the pediatrician and/or scheduling a consultation with a mental health professional.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Consider incorporating a vitamin supplement regimen into your child&rsquo;s daily meal plan. While a more health-conscious diet alone cannot guarantee to safeguard your child from potentially developing a mental health-related disorder, a regular dose of either a multivitamin or nutrient-specific supplements with his or her morning breakfast may help to reduce the likelihood of developing anxiety or depressive symptoms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember the importance of a family dinner. Most of life&rsquo;s special moments&mdash; birthdays, marriages, graduations, etc. &mdash;are celebrated with a good meal. And while family dinners might seem like a thing of the past, this does not devalue the importance of gathering around the dinner table as a family and celebrating one another&rsquo;s company. Family dinners have been linked to stimulating a child&rsquo;s cognitive development, improve healthy eating habits, as well as reducing stress and enhancing a child&rsquo;s emotional resiliency.</p>'), ('1', '1', '265', '1', '<p><em>By Betty Richardson</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The place</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Owned by Camden Hauge, founder of Shanghai Supperclub, <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/12027\">Egg</a> is an airy little caf&eacute; on Xiangyang Bei Lu. By day it serves low-key comfort dishes (many of which involve fried, poached or scrambled eggs), but every Thursday night it transforms to become a &lsquo;chef&rsquo;s table,&rsquo; an intimate dinner for just 10 people, who eat a multi-course meal prepared by a guest chef cooking from the adjacent open kitchen. The space is small, but high ceilings and a light color scheme keep it a comfortable place to be.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The food</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>During breakfast and lunch, Egg&rsquo;s menu is concise. Much fuss has been made over the price of the avocado toast (RMB55), to which an egg can be added for RMB8. For some people, this price is too high. For others, it&rsquo;s ok. What we will say is it&rsquo;s a big portion, tasty, filling and pretty healthy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Less healthy, but more flavorsome is the fried rice compressed into a waffle (RMB70), topped with an egg, lao gan ma (Chinese chili sauce) and &ndash; wait for it &ndash; Spam. We have recently discovered Spam as the delicious, savory mystery meat that it is. No, we are not being ironic, and this dish was mad good.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another dish that&rsquo;s been catching a lot of heat is the spring shakshouka (RMB60), which comes with poached egg (still runny), feta, stewed greens and toast. You can also get a side of chili-candied bacon for RMB20, which packs a serious punch. We loved it, but it ain&rsquo;t for the faint of heart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is available during the day. But what about the Chef&rsquo;s Table experience? We went to the one hosted by Chef Austin Hu from <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/7898\">Madison</a>, at RMB288 per person for five courses. With just 10 fellow diners, some of whom were strangers (nice ones), it was an unforgettable experience that reminded us how fun dinner parties can be. This was the first of the weekly Chef&rsquo;s Tables. If you want in on the action, you&rsquo;ll need to email Hauge directly (Camden@eggshanghai.com). <strong>2.5/3</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>The vibe</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Relaxed and faintly daydream-y, Egg is part way Melbourne-style caf&eacute;, part Scandinavian hipster design studio. It&rsquo;s a place to come for quick bites, studying and hanging out too. Service is un-intrusive and friendly, unremarkable for all the right reasons. <strong>1/1&nbsp;</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Value for money</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>In some people&rsquo;s eyes, Egg will not represent value for money, since it&rsquo;s largely impossible to leave full for under RMB100. As such, Egg won&rsquo;t be the place you&rsquo;re going to visit three times a week if you&rsquo;re on a tight budget. However, it is not overly expensive, and the portion sizes are generous. <strong>0.5/1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<h2>TOTAL VERDICT: 4/5</h2>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Price: </strong>lunch RMB130 per person/dinner RMB288 (Thursday only)<br />\r\n<strong>Who&rsquo;s going: </strong>mix of young locals and expats<br />\r\n<strong>Good for:</strong> lunch, brunch, breakfast, chef&rsquo;s tables</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/12027\">See Listing here</a>.&nbsp;12 Xiangyang Bei Lu, by Changle Lu 襄阳北路12号，近长乐路.

Already present in the city with a shop in Jing&rsquo;an, the European menswear brand has recently opened a flagship/mansion on Anfu Lu, a three-story space that blends contemporary design touches with a thoroughly former French Concession feel (wooden floors, art deco-inspired fixtures).

This could explain two things: 1: Why I&#39;ve been accused of being an unimaginative cook. And 2: The huge bags under my children&#39;s eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, I resent the accusation from certain members of my marriage that I&#39;m not quite as creative as those chefs she sees on the TV. They&#39;re mostly about nine years old! My point is they&rsquo;re so young they don&rsquo;t know what they like yet. I, being old, have developed a finely honed belief in what I like. And it&#39;s so good I want to pass it on to my kids. And unimaginative? Even as I type this I&rsquo;m contemplating boldly overhauling my signature dish and renaming it &ldquo;Meat and FOUR Veg.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, family cooking is demanding. I now know why my own mother seemingly simply gave up, alas some years before I was born. I&#39;ve heard some people get organized on a Monday and plan, and shop for, <em>all </em>the dinners they&#39;ll cook that week. This to me sounds like dabbling in the dark arts. Or at least it&#39;s risibly nerdy. It also doesn&#39;t account for what food mood you might be in when 6:30 rears its ugly head on the ensuing, locked-in days.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can perform in the kitchen when I try, a bit, but sometimes with kids you wonder about the point of it all. A friend once asked our nine-year-old Lani her favorite of all dad&#39;s meals. I puffed out my chest as a pleased, if not smug, smile spread across my face. This was a no-brainer. Years ago I was moved to look up something called a &ldquo;recipe&rdquo; (more dark arts, as I see it). This was because we were living on the coast and I felt like seafood chowder. It takes some trouble to make, but I can honestly say that whenever I do, people gasp, and in a nice way. Lani served up her answer without hesitation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;Leftovers!&quot; she said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I served up a smile, on wry. Leftovers have long been a signature dish of the harried parent. One parenting writer recently said the biggest bafflement of his childhood was that leftovers was all he ever ate, and that &quot;the original meal was never found.&quot; To be fair, my leftovers are special.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I once beheld a fridge full of old meals and thought how terrible a lump of sweet and sour pork would look beside a slice of pizza and half a sandwich. In a burst of inspiration I threw them all into the blender. I added an egg (there&#39;s nothing that can&#39;t be improved with an egg) made little patties and fried them up. I then added the key ingredient of surprise, by calling it &quot;Dad&#39;s Leftover Surprise,&quot; and voila, a sort of miracle was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kids love it. I love it, because it avoids waste, and we have fun while learning the beautiful art of food preparation, or &quot;chucking stuff into the blender.&quot; There are usually enough vegetables amidst the beloved &ldquo;lefties&rdquo; to make sure it&#39;s even nutritious. Mostly though, I think the kids love it because it usually gets drowned in tomato sauce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That&#39;s possibly what I&#39;ve learned the most clearly about feeding kids. They&#39;ll eat almost anything if it&#39;s covered in ketchup. And spaghetti. Never forget the spaghetti.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But one parenting/cooking tip beats them all: When you really are about to cook their favorite meal, always ask them first what they&#39;d like for dinner. Chances are they&#39;ll say what you&#39;re about to prepare. Nothing aids kids&#39; appetites more than having the empowering choice of picking dinner.

It&#39;s been shuttered for ages, but it&#39;s now open with a pleasant little patio, tachonomiya chair-less tables inside, a glass-ceilinged dining room and a chic second floor.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Famous in Japan for representing &lsquo;Michelin for the masses,&rsquo; Oreno&#39;s concept is about having upscale food for low, low prices. How is this possible in Xintiandi? They limit your time to two hours per table, and offer some standing-only tables in a bid to generate high turnover.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The food</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oreno&#39;s menu contains a broad spectrum of dishes, many of which suffer embarrassing Chinglish typos. Most of these wouldn&#39;t have made it through had somebody bestirred themselves to use spell check: &#39;Countney Pate,&#39; anyone? French crab meat &#39;tata&#39;? Or how about a &#39;Tomahwak&#39; steak? Sic, sic and sic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Happily, once it gets to the table, the food is pretty good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chilled &#39;sea urchin (uni) mousse with chicken gels&#39; (RMB68) was yummy and a big portion. It would have been better with crusty bread to break up the soft texture, but there didn&#39;t seem to be any going around.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next, a mysteriously titled beast: &#39;pizza eggs&#39; (RMB70). We wondered briefly if this would involve egg-shaped pizzas, but were proven wrong when a black truffle and mushroom puree-laden pizza arrived, with an egg on top. Nicely charred crust, but could have done with a touch longer in the oven to crisp up the base.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next a massive portion of &#39;linguini sea crab&#39; (RMB70), big enough for two people if you&#39;re sharing dishes. We liked the generous lashings of cream-based seafood sauce mingled in with just-about-al dente linguine noodles. This dish won&#39;t rock your world, but again, for the price it&#39;s honest and hearty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Food verdict: 2/3</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vibe</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Xintiandi is not known for its characterful restaurants, and Oreno isn&#39;t about to change that. Still, it&#39;s pretty pleasant in here, and the terrace makes for a fantastic people-watching spot. The wait staff are accommodating, speak English and some help recommend dishes to order.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expect this spot to get pretty busy in the future given its high foot traffic location. As such, service can be slightly laggy, especially since Oreno is newly opened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Vibe: 0.5/1</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Value for money</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of portion and price ratios, Oreno is excellent value. It wouldn&#39;t be impossible to be completely full here and spend under RMB100 (especially if you eat pasta or pizza).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, order wine, bottled water or cocktails and watch your bill inflate substantially (Voss is RMB60 a bottle). This is par for the course &ndash; they have rent to pay and, as with most places, beverages sales are essential for a restaurant&#39;s survival.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Oreno isn&#39;t yet a culinary destination, but overall it&#39;s one of the better options for dining in Xintiandi, and one we&#39;ll return to with pleasure.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Value for money: </strong>1/1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>TOTAL VERDICT: </strong>3.5.5</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Price: </strong>RMB100+ per person</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who&#39;s going: </strong>Locals and Xintiandi tourists</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Good for: </strong>Xintiandi dining, good value</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// No 16, Lane 181, Taicang Lu, by Madang Lu太仓路181弄16号，近马当路.

They can choose the vegetarian hot meal such as lasagna or other pasta dishes, stir fried vegetables, noodles, vegetable bakes, samosas etc. These main meals come with fresh vegetables and a side salad, soup and fruit. If they don&rsquo;t want the set meal they can have a main salad, a sandwich, sushi or wraps. Of course there are more choices for non-vegetarians, but vegetarians are quite well catered to.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melissa</strong><strong>：</strong>In addition to the items they bring for their snack, my two younger sons enjoy the school lunch. They mention that they like to eat the noodle dishes and fried rice, the yummy dumplings, the Chinese style fish and all of the fruit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Claire: </strong>When eating school lunches they have several choices. These include carbs in the form of potato dishes, pasta, rice or breads and protein through a variety of meat options, eggs, couscous and fish. There is also a wide range of fruit and vegetables.</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left:18.0pt\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you feel that your kids get enough nutrients to last them through the day?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> They have plenty of healthy food to sustain them &ndash; if they choose to eat it!&nbsp;Our youngest can be quite picky so we are constantly pushing her to make healthy choices and to actually eat a bit more. The school staff also tries to watch out for this and encourage good eating habits.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Claire: </strong>I feel that a balanced diet is provided over the course of a day, though I would always welcome an additional supply of fruit offered at strategically-timed snack points and calcium in yogurts or skimmed milk drinks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How aware are you of your kids&rsquo; food habits during a school day?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> The girls know what constitutes healthy eating and we trust them to make good choices, at least most of the time. Over the years, school staff has also been supportive in watching out for our youngest daughter to ensure she eats enough and makes balanced choices.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melissa:</strong> I am aware of the snacks provided by the school as I have seen them given to each class. The teachers send home class schedules so I am aware of the times that snacks, and time to eat, will be provided. I also read the schools&#39; weekly cafeteria menu schedule and am generally clear on the nutrients contained in each item. I periodically ask the boys about their snacks and if they feel full enough during the day. Just a quick check here and there.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Claire: </strong>I am quite on the ball when it comes to knowing what Kate and Oliver eat. We discuss daily what they both have had at school. I also know that if they have the opportunity to eat or drink a &lsquo;sweet&rsquo; treat they will take it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is there any way you think the school lunch could be improved?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> The lunches are good but of course there are always ways to improve. All schools need to work hard to ensure they are sourcing high quality ingredients to provide nutritional meals, especially here in China. It is also important to make food that will be both healthy and appealing to children - our school parent food committee works closely with the canteen staff to continually look at how they can improve menus and generally consider how the lunch offer can be better. This also involves training canteen staff to serve balanced portions and to present the food well. It would also be good to increase the range of vegetarian dishes as many non-vegetarian children also want to opt for these dishes sometimes. This is something BISS Puxi are working on for next year.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melissa:</strong> I think the menu generally offers enough variety to meet the palate needs of most children, even when considering cultural and familial tastes. I think the actual process during lunch, which has teachers monitoring the students, is very efficient. It steers children toward eating versus talking, and helps them to pace themselves in order to eat the entire meal. For me, working around a child&#39;s eating habits is the most difficult obstacle to good nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Claire: </strong>School lunches are always an interesting topic and I&rsquo;m confident my two would say they would like more options. However, if they were to pick the menu it might not necessarily be a balanced one!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you think there is any difference between the school lunches they are getting in Shanghai compared to what they would get in their home countries?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> The menu choices are possibly a bit wider to cater to the internationally diverse student group as the school needs to respect all pallets and preferences. They wouldn&rsquo;t get sushi or Singapore noodles at home. It is also great that there is no vending machine in sight, so no fizzy drinks, crisps or chocolate available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melissa:</strong> We embrace the local palate and mix of cultures, and feel that in the school. Though the boys haven&#39;t gone to school in the U.S. or Finland, we are aware that the school lunches include fare that is considered mainstream in those countries. That is to be expected, and acceptance of this is a vital part of life as an expat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do your kids think the school food is tasty?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melissa: </strong>Yes. My twins often come home and mention that their lunch was &ldquo;the best food ever.&rdquo; Luckily, I haven&#39;t felt insulted (yet). I have tried the dumplings and some other dishes during school events, and agree they have good flavor. In fact, my son Max and I were fishing yesterday, and he said he wanted me to cook the fish exactly as the school serves it. My eldest son has insisted on a packed lunch since he came to the school, but he has agreed to try the sandwich bar during the new school year, and that is a major step for him. What can I say? He likes sandwiches.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are your kids active throughout the day?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> Yes &ndash; as well as full days of learning they are involved in after school activities and sports.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melissa: </strong>A big YES! My boys wake up at 5am every morning, and drag me &ndash; okay, actually my husband - out of bed with them. They are lively and animated immediately, and they will run and play soccer before the school bus arrives. When they get home from school they are still ready to climb and run and wrestle&hellip; it seems never ending! We have a nightly routine mainly just to calm them down enough to sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Claire: </strong>Both Oliver and Kate love sport and are very active. They participate every day of the week in at least one sporting activity, and they love football.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you think your kids generally eat healthy?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ali:</strong> Yes &ndash; for the most part they eat well and know what healthy food is. However, we believe in a balanced approach and all things are fine in moderation, so they do also get some treats and the occasional fizzy drinks (though not too often).</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Melissa: </strong>Yes. I think we do our best at home, and feel confident that the school lunches are also helping with nutritional goals. Perhaps we aren&#39;t always succeeding on a daily basis, but I am pretty sure we are doing well on a weekly basis when all is considered. <a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>I believe in providing our boys with the best in nutrition, but I also think it is fun to let them have a treat or two each week! I still remember when my mother would give me my favorite candy each Friday as a treat for eating well during the week. It makes me smile, and I want that for my boys as well as the good overall nutrition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Claire: </strong>I am happy that they both eat a healthy and balanced diet. They do like treats but &lsquo;everything in moderation&rsquo; is my mantra!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '272', '1', '<p>August 29</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Sweft Dance Company Soft Opening Free Class</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The new Sweft Dance Company is opening its doors for a soft opening to both kids and adults.&nbsp; All levels are welcome with classes ranging from hip-hop to jazz to yoga to African.&nbsp; To register make sure to send your name and class time to their wechat ID: International_Sweft.&nbsp; Take a look at the flyer above to</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// 1-5pm, 940 Changde Rd. near Changping Rd, 7F.

The <em>Wallace and Gromit</em> spin-off is back in the spotlight again for his film debut in <em>Shaun the Sheep Movie</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The charming family-friendly feature is already a hit, grossing nearly USD60 million worldwide, while opening on the Mainland last month and across America in August. Like other Aardman Animations productions, the stop-motion animation is a visual treat, especially during scenes where characters whiz through the crevices of the big city modeled after London.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Story wise, it&rsquo;s a simple one fueled by charming characters. In need of a day off, the unusually sharp Shaun the Sheep concocts a plan to distract the farmer, Mr. X.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, things go awry when Mr. X is whisked away to the city, awakening in a hospital with no memory. Blazer the dog immediately goes to the city to find the farmer. He&rsquo;s followed by Shaun, and then the remaining flock who must deftly elude a fierce animal catcher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rather than rely on pop culture references like many Disney and Pixar fare, <em>Shaun the Sheep</em> relies on classic hijinks. When Blazer is finally able to sneak into the hospital disguised as a doctor, he finds himself leading surgery. Shaun and friends&rsquo; misadventures at a fancy restaurant are full of slapstick fun.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As for Mr. X, he finds himself the toast of the town. Thanks to his sheep shearing ways, he&rsquo;s stumbled onto the hair trend of the moment and becomes a stylist star. When Shaun and friends finally find the farmer, he shies away from them with no memory of them at all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The final thirty minutes is devoted to Shaun and friends trying to revive the farmer&rsquo;s past life, with its riotous fun ending with a touching scene back on the farm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '274', '1', '<p>It&rsquo;s not exactly news to learn that China has a serious&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/search?item=air%20pollution\" target=\"_blank\">air pollution</a>&nbsp;problem, but according to a&nbsp;<a href=\"http://berkeleyearth.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/China-Air-Quality-Paper-July-2015.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">new study</a>, the nation&rsquo;s air quality is even worse than previously thought.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For those living in China, the air we breathe is killing roughly 4,000 people every day, or 1.6 million a year, accounting for around 17 percent of all deaths in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Using four months&rsquo; worth of data from 1,500 Chinese monitoring stations across the country, scientists from the University of California&rsquo;s Berkeley Earth mapped the extent and sources of air pollution.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not surprisingly, they found that pollution is widespread, but is particularly intense in the heavily populated east, in a &ldquo;corridor that extends from near&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/post/town-crier-shanghais-level-of-pm-25-particles-have-dropped-by-a-staggering-10\" target=\"_blank\">Shanghai</a>&nbsp;to north of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/post/photos-beijing-marathon-runners-trudge-through-hazardous-smog-in-gas-masks\" target=\"_blank\">Beijing</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"China Air Pollution Map\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/china-airpollution-map.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you live in&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/post/photos-this-is-how-bad-the-smog-is-in-beijing-and-beyond-right-now\" target=\"_blank\">Beijing</a>, where just breathing like a regular human is the equivalent of smoking almost 40 cigarettes a day, according to Berkeley Earth scientific director Richard Muller, you might want to consider moving south to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/search?item=fujian\" target=\"_blank\">Fujian</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/search?item=guangdong\" target=\"_blank\">Guangdong</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/search?item=yunnan\" target=\"_blank\">Yunnan</a>.

With proper flakes of chocolate and a delicately minty feel that didn&#39;t overpower the creaminess, this scoop had a surprisingly homemade vibe&nbsp;despite its&nbsp;appearances.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also&nbsp;delicious:&nbsp;<strong>amarena&nbsp;cherry&nbsp;with chocolate.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Undeniably beautiful with its soft streaks of pink and white, subtly punctuated by dark chocolate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Miso caramel</strong>&nbsp;was another big hitter, and perfect if you like your salty&nbsp;&#39;n&#39;&nbsp;sweet flavor combinations.

INSERT INTO `th_contents` VALUES ('1', '1', '278', '1', '<p>By: Jamie Barys, Glutton Guide Publisher</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Decapitated fish still gasping for breath, wriggling eels in plastic bins and unrecognizable vegetables &ndash; these are the shockers that frighten many of Shanghai&rsquo;s new expats away from the wet markets, but don&rsquo;t give up on your local grocery so quickly. Foreign markets and online grocery stores may have plenty to offer when it comes to imports, but nothing tops wet markets when it comes to freshness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wet markets get their name from their slick floors, a combination of produce vendors spritzing their veggies to enhance shelf life, fishmongers selling live fish that thrash in tubs and butchers slaughtering chickens to order (although this rarely happens now in a post-avian flu world). Today, wet markets are made up of regulated vendors who source local ingredients and sell them at peak freshness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the increasingly fragmented food shopping market, hypermarkets like Carrefour and online retailers like Yi Hao Dian have gained market share, but wet markets are still a must-visit for fresh vegetables. Produce is usually bought during the pre-dawn hours at wholesale markets (where some of the hypermarkets also shop), and these fresh-from-the-farm veggies are predominantly sourced from suburban farms within 50 kilometers of the city. The lack of refrigeration and packaging at wet markets actually works in favor of the customers, as produce is bought and sold daily without being left for weeks in a cold storage facility before making it to the storefront.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Twenty years ago, ration tickets would have been required to purchase a daily allotment of grains and greens, but haggling is now your ticket to a good deal. In the 1980s, wet markets became one of the many &ldquo;liberalized&rdquo; businesses released from state ownership, allowing vendors to set their own prices. Now almost 80 percent of the stalls in Shanghai&rsquo;s wet markets are privately owned, so it&rsquo;s important for shoppers to arm themselves with some knowledge of what&rsquo;s in season and how much things cost. The best bet is to find the sweetest little old lady selling cucumbers and go back to her often &ndash; she&rsquo;ll start throwing in fistfuls of cilantro or a bulb of garlic for free after she realizes you are a regular.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese customers tend to shop at these markets daily to maximize freshness, and thanks to the municipal government directives, Shanghai is supposed to have one wet market per square kilometer by 2020. That doesn&rsquo;t mean wet markets aren&rsquo;t falling victim to the city&rsquo;s rapid urbanization. The famously stinky Jiashan Market at the corner of Taiyuan Lu and Jianguo Lu was shut down earlier this year, and Tangjiawan and its neighboring market streets are slated for demolition in August.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But Chinese wet markets as a whole aren&#39;t going anywhere. The ones that are being torn down are the ones with the most character, but often the ones that have unlicensed vendors on the street (Tangjiawan) or shoddy construction that was originally only intended to be temporary (Jiashan). The government has made it very clear that food security is a top priority, and while hypermarkets like Carrefour generally have higher hygiene standards than typical wet markets, they also rely more on imported products while wet markets support local agriculture.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To learn more visit: www.gluttonguides.com</p>'), ('1', '1', '279', '1', '<p>Sometimes I feel like my internet connection is an angry girlfriend who screams &ldquo;I&rsquo;LL TEACH YOU TO LEAVE ME ALL ALONE!&rdquo; when I go home for the summer. I swear every time I go on vacation I come back to an internet connection that has just given up on life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the best things about going home is that I get to take part in so much awesome fast internet. That means catching up on Netflix, watching youtube, posting non-stop on Facebook, and generally ignoring my children. This year I made it my mission after the kids were asleep to catch up on all of the movies that I promised myself I would watch one day. These included <em>Cider House Rules</em>, <em>Never Let Me Go</em>, and <em>Howard the Duck</em> (that admittedly I&rsquo;ve watched before&hellip;but I love it! And you can never take that away from me &ldquo;worst moves ever&rdquo; top 10 lists!). To say that I was spoiled with my internet usage was an understatement. For the first few days I found myself turning on my VPN out of habit until realizing I didn&#39;t need that anymore because I wasn&#39;t surrounded by the Great Firewall of China for once. FREE AT LAST!!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of the time I just want to throw an epic tantrum worthy of my 2 year old when the internet slows down to a crawl here. I try to remember that I now live in a country that holds roughly 20% of the whole world&rsquo;s population and they&rsquo;re all fighting for a piece of the web. All those people connecting in some way or another combined with the government censoring everything from Google to articles about what the government censors (so you can&rsquo;t even find out exactly what they&rsquo;re censoring!) is bound to slow things down. Keeping this in mind, it doesn&rsquo;t make me more rational when I&#39;m watching my gmail saying &ldquo;still waiting&rdquo; while trying to send JUST ONE email before 1am! Instead there I am screaming &ldquo;C&rsquo;MON!!!&rdquo; at my screen as minutes turn into hours.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It wasn&#39;t until I tried to load Taobao in the middle of the night while fighting off fierce jet lag (online spending of Ben&rsquo;s money usually sends me happily back into dreamland) that I realized I had met my internet breaking point. Not one single glorious image while arbitrarily searching for &ldquo;Ghostbusters&rdquo; showed up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what am I to do? Quit the internet cold turkey? Take up an instrument? I&rsquo;m way more inclined to try to make bunny ears antennae out of tinfoil and attach it to my modem to see if that makes any difference. Which it probably will because as you also know by living here that sometimes the most ridiculous solution in China turns out to be the best one. All I know is that something needs to be done soon because the fall TV schedule is about to start and I&rsquo;ll be damned if I have to wait for boxsets to watch my stories!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&rsquo;ll sit here and hit refresh until something gives. Maybe most of you will lose interest after coming back from holiday, settle into your routine of Chinese living and forget all about the internet - leaving more room for me to stream. I guess the only downside to you all ignoring the internet is that you probably won&rsquo;t read this&hellip;oh well I still call it a win. Now get off my internet so I can stream all the episodes of <em>Orange is the New Black</em>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '280', '1', '<p>Concerning news, it seems escalator incidents are not limited to freak accidents in Hubei; some 300 cases of injuries have been reported on Shanghai Metro escalators and elevators in the first seven months of the year, report the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.shanghaidaily.com/metro/society/300-hurt-in-Metro-escalator-accidents/shdaily.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">Shanghai Daily</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is (almost all) your fault though, according to Metro operator Shanghai Shentong, who said that carelessness was to blame in more than 90 percent of cases (just like&nbsp;<a href=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/post/shanghai-mall-blames-amputee-victim-in-chinas-latest-escalator-accident\" target=\"_blank\">this incident</a>, then).

While speaking with a few of the instructors at the studio, I could feel their conviction for the art and practice of yoga.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Main Yoga Shanghai\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/Mainyoga_1.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Space and Vibe</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Main Yoga is hidden in the back of Ambassy Compound near the pool on Huaihai Lu. Although it was a bit difficult to find at first, it was worth the visit.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The yoga studio itself is quite simplistic with modern d&eacute;cor, having two changing rooms (one for each sex) with lockers, one shower, and a separate small bathroom. They provide each guest with a mat (which are in very good condition and clean) and a towel at the end of your class to those who didn&rsquo;t bring one of their own. Although the yoga studio is quite small overall, this is what the staff and instructors pride themselves on. One of the instructors explained that they have tried to get away from the commercial aspect that many yoga studios nowadays have become. Main Yoga strives to provide an authentic, intimate setting for their clients, straying away from the trend of becoming a mega studio and chain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One thing that certainly sets this studio apart from others is its support for local artists in the area. In the lobby of the studio they feature a new artist monthly, trying to support local talent in Shanghai. They occasionally have art shows and clients are able to purchase the art at any point off the wall.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Main Yoga Shanghai\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/Mainyoga_2.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Classes</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The studio offers a wide range of classes to suit a variety of needs. The studio has 12 teachers in all and teaches classes such as yoga therapy, water yoga, Yin yoga, and Ashtanga yoga. The studio mainly consists of beginner to intermediate students, but they hope to gain a wider range of levels as their current students progress and they broaden their membership.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Main Yoga Shanghai\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/Mainyoga_3.png\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I opted to try the core power class, which was a moderately challenging class. Although the teacher did not speak fluent English, she used a very hands-on approach correcting students and assisting them to obtain the correct technique and position. I found this to be very helpful and I think other students in the class did as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Main Yoga Shanghai\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/Mainyoga_4.png\" style=\"float:left; margin-bottom:10px; margin-right:10px; width:30%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The studio has many options for mothers and soon-to-be mothers. In addition to offering both prenatal and postnatal yoga classes, they also offer family yoga classes every weekend for mother and baby. If interested in the prenatal or postnatal yoga, you will need to first speak with the instructor to discuss your needs and assess your wellbeing and limitations during the class. For family yoga, mothers are welcome to bring their babies (must be at least 3 months old) to join in a mother and baby bonding yoga session. The family yoga instructor explained that mom and baby yoga is designed to comfort both the mother and child. Often soon after birth, a mother is hesitant to leave her newborn and can have anxiety or is distracted during post<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>natal classes. This option allows a mother to be focused on her baby while doing yoga, often using her baby as a prop or weight during the class. The sessions also usually include small baby massage sessions in class in order to learn your baby&rsquo;s pressure points and other ways to calm a child.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// See a listing for Main Yoga </em><a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/shanghai/venue/11825\"><em>here</em></a><em>.</em></p>'), ('1', '1', '282', '1', '<p>September 9</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Mission Impossible: Rogue Nation</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rated PG-13 in America, this movie will make for a great night out with your teen.&nbsp; Tom Cruise returns as super-spy Ethan Hunt in the fifth installment of the action series.

Throw in the volatility of a fluctuating schedule, time zone and ever-changing location, and staying healthy while on the road turns into an epic battle. For my fellow road warriors, here are some simple tips for fighting the bulge while living out of your suitcase.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Know the enemy</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>First, what are we up against? Fatigue, stress and loss of control are the most common culprits for poor health decisions while traveling. Think of every day on the road as a battle, and the person you are fighting is yourself:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; Your inner athlete vs your inner sloth</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; Your motivation vs every tired bone in your body</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; Your bikini bod vs sweatpants city</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Make smart choices</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; Did you win today? Did you meet your fitness and health goals? Or did you give in to a downward spiral of unhealthy habits because one slip-up paved the way for another?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; Having a game plan is the best path to victory.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Bring your gym with you</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You don&rsquo;t need a gym to work out. Many hotels in Asia tend to have inconvenient gym hours (9am-8pm), times that typically mean you&rsquo;re not there. Don&rsquo;t let that be an excuse to not exercise. Pick your poison and put it at the top of your packing list:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; Running shoes. There is no better way to see a city. Apps like Nike+ or MapmyRun can help make these lonesome jogs a social affair. Do you have other friends who are also on the road often? Use these apps to challenge them to virtual races, which will hold you accountable and keep you motivated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; Any workout DVD from your local store. The P90X plyometric routine requires minimal equipment &ndash; your own body weight is your gym. To amp up resistance training in the hotel room, purchase weight bands from Taobao. Easy to tuck into your carry-on, slip them over a doorknob or the bottom of your foot and get training. Bands are great for strength training.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; A yoga mat. The benefits of yoga deserve their own article. Do yoga and do it often. If lack of flexibility is your excuse, here&rsquo;s a tip: Crank up the heat in your hotel room and create your own hot yoga studio. Heat increases blood flow which helps relax ligaments, enabling greater flexibility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&raquo;&raquo; If you&rsquo;re at a loss as to how to go about crafting your own workout, there is a wide range of websites that offer online cardio</p>\r\n\r\n<p>and yoga classes. If you have a VPN, you can find many for free on YouTube.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If possible, work out first thing in the morning. You never know what the day holds and saving your workout until the end of the day could lead to it never happening at all. It also psychologically locks you in to make better food choices throughout the day. Why would you want to ruin that great work-out you fit in first thing in the&nbsp;morning?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Breakfast like a champ, snack&nbsp;</strong><strong>like a kid</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Serotonin is a neurotransmitter that impacts many body functions, most importantly, appetite, sleep and mood. 90</p>\r\n\r\n<p>percent of serotonin is produced in the stomach. Unfortunately unhealthy foods such as high carb or highly processed foods can result in a surge of serotonin (like a sugar high) which may give you a temporary lift, but will also result in a rapid crash. The key is to manage your blood sugar levels so that instead of high highs and low lows, you are sustained with consistent energy throughout the day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Breakfast like a champ</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is often the meal you have the most control over while</p>\r\n\r\n<p>traveling. Make it count &ndash; it should be your biggest meal of the day. Healthy options include items high in protein (eggs, lean meats), whole grains, low- or non-fat dairy and fruits and vegetables. Eating a healthy breakfast that is full of variety can help curb hunger for longer as the body works a slow burn to digest the food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Snack like a kid</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Your blood sugar dips every three to five hours after a meal. Frequent snacking keeps the metabolism fired up and blood sugar steady. Extreme hunger can lead your body to go into famine mode so that when you do eat, more of the calories you intake get stored away. It&#39;s important to always keep healthy snack options with you to keep you in a steady state of full (but not stuffed). Eat often, but just a little bit each time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>80/20 Enjoy the road!</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Finally, one of the joys of being on the road is to see and experience new things.

INSERT INTO `th_contents` VALUES ('1', '1', '299', '1', '<p><strong>A new <em>Urban Family</em> weekly series where we ask a Shanghai based community organization or individual to tell us 5 things our readers must know.&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Riley Van Patten works with Little Brothers Entertainment who will be hosting a Shanghai Basketball tournament from October 17-18.&nbsp; As an avid basketball fan, he explains why your child should experience playing youth basketball.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. MEMORY: You&rsquo;ll never forget that one game</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Youth basketball leaves memories that stay with you forever. I&rsquo;ll never forget the shot I hit against Pasadena High School, &nbsp;or my team&rsquo;s incredible upset in 3<sup>rd</sup> grade. I also won&rsquo;t forget the time my team travelled 500 miles to be crushed in the &ldquo;1999 Big Time Tournament&rdquo;!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. SELF CONFIDENCE: Sometimes you&rsquo;ll have to miss 5 shots before you make 1</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While playing any sport you face risks; the risk to miss a shot, move the wrong way, or make the wrong decision.&nbsp; Believing in yourself enough to accept these risks and still achieve success is a powerful tool in building self-confidence. &nbsp;It takes belief in yourself to set goals, whether or not the goals are achieved the confidence never leaves. Self confidence is something that is important to instill in a child as early on so they can be comfortable with themselves and their talents.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3. SOCIALIZATION: Brothers and sisters in arms</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everything you experience in a basketball will be with your teammates. On the court and off, a bond is built over the course of time that always stays. Teamwork and camaraderie is key to playing youth basketball. To this day some of my best friends and memories are playing with guys when I was 12.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4. DETERMINATION: There&rsquo;s always a challenge</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"margin-left: 36pt;\">Inevitably, a team and its individual players are challenged. How that challenge is accepted shapes outcomes of games and players as people. The more challenges you face throughout youth, the better you become at accepting those challenges. This makes you more prepared for future challenges. Whether it&rsquo;s a missed shot, tough opponents, our individual circumstances---attitude is everything.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5. PREPERATION: Something unexpected always happens</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Basketball, much like life, is extremely dynamic. Nothing ever happens exactly as planned (especially in high-pressure high-stakes situations). However, you learn that with sufficient preparation you can provide yourself the tools to best handle those circumstances. You may be caught off-guard and have to shoot a last second shot to win the game! With enough preparation you&rsquo;ll surprise yourself with how you prepared you where for the unprepared!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To join in and get your kid involved in youth basketball, check out the 1Ball Fall Slam event this weekend!

Not necessarily fashion, but just things that are cool before they become too mainstream. I&rsquo;m like an annoying hipster that way.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I remember when I was young I read all about this magical device that was like having your very own virtual pet in your pocket. I saved my money, went to Chinatown and bought one for $50! Since it didn&rsquo;t have any English instructions my grandmother took me to the dim sum place and had the waitress translate it all for me. Six months later, Tamagotchi started to sell at Toys&rsquo;R&rsquo;Us for $12.99. But that&rsquo;s okay; not only did I have mine sooner - mine was more authentic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It quickly drove me nuts and I virtually starved it to death till it &ldquo;died&rdquo;.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I also killed off my Furby.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most trends died for me when the trend itself was in full swing. The only exception to that was the Japanese nail art trend that I picked up on a 2007 trip to Japan and have been doing it ever since. So when I moved here one of the things I was excited about was the prospect of picking up the latest and greatest fad - cause let&rsquo;s admit it: some of the craziest things come out of Asia!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the first things I noticed at Century Park on weekends was whole families dressing the same - SAMESIES! I guess from one perspective it&rsquo;s cute and functional - I mean, when your kid goes busting out into a giant crowd of people and they&rsquo;re dressed exactly the same as you in a bright pink Hello Kitty outfit, then yea, chances are you&rsquo;re going to find your kid. But on the other hand there are couples that dress the same down to the socks and shoes. Sweetheart clothes. I asked Ben if he would be willing to do that for us and he said &ldquo;as long as it&rsquo;s all NY Giants and jeans I&rsquo;ll consider it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, I won&rsquo;t. I only wear a football jersey when I&rsquo;m forced to on Superbowl Sunday.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are the glasses for cool kids without any lenses in them. I actually wear glasses myself and growing up the last thing I ever wanted to do was actually WEAR my glasses. I would sit at the front of the class staring intently at the board not because I was interested at all in the lesson but because I wouldn&#39;t wear my glasses and couldn&#39;t see a thing! The day I got contacts was one of the best days of my life! So I&rsquo;ll never understand or get on board with false glasses - especially those without any lenses in them! I mean, at least put some effort into making it look like you&rsquo;re a glasses wearer if that&rsquo;s what you&rsquo;re gonna do!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Then there are pajama people. If you&rsquo;ve walked the streets of Shanghai (especially in Yuyuan Gardens) guaranteed you&rsquo;ve seen a pajama clad person! And it&rsquo;s not only the elderly; we&rsquo;re talking middle aged men to kids to their moms. Everyone loves them some flannel pajamas! This is one trend that I could possibly get on board with. I mean - what teen in the 90s didn&rsquo;t attempt to wear flannel pajama pants with slippers out of the house before their grandmother dragged them back inside and insisted they put on jeans or look like a hobo? No? Just me then&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While waiting for a lunch date with some friends near Tianzifang I spotted the latest in Chinese trends. Many people were walking by going about their business completely ignoring the fact that they had sprouts or flowers of some kind growing out of their hair. The first one I saw was a little girl about 7 and I thought: oh cute! Then I saw a grown man&hellip;and his friend&hellip;just hanging out wechatting, sprouts and all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&rsquo;m jumping on the bandwagon now while it&rsquo;s still early. That&rsquo;s what you have to do to be a true trendsetter after all!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I mean, I have no idea where the trend came from or what it&rsquo;s even about but I&rsquo;m going to assume it&rsquo;s all about global warming awareness and protesting deforestation of the rainforest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Or, how our minds are the seeds to sprout new ideas to change the world? Oh, I like that one.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So when I wear my sprout it&rsquo;s not me thats weird its YOU who doesn&rsquo;t want to be the change in the world.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s time everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sprout up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '302', '1', '<p><strong>October 14-18</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Rolex Tennis Masters</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>As the only ATP World Tour Masters 1000 tournament held outside of Europe and North America, the Shanghai Rolex Masters features a star-studded draw.

Inspect the vendor&rsquo;s station</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cleanliness is next to godliness, especially when it comes to street food, so check out their mise en place and utensils. If your vendor has a jar for money and asks you to retrieve your own change, that&rsquo;s a very good sign. Money is one of the dirtiest things we touch daily, so this means that they are already factoring that into their cleanliness.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alternatively, some vendors use utensils or gloves when handling food, so touching money isn&rsquo;t as much of an issue.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Check the vendor&rsquo;s oil</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Reused oil is a problem in a lot of the smaller cities around China, but you will occasionally run across a spendthrift vendor frying street food in dark oil. Avoid this at all costs, as reused oil can be dangerous. Most vendors do not keep their oil in its original container. Instead they pour it into smaller water bottles that are much easier to handle than a bulky jug when you&rsquo;re tossing noodles in a wok with your right hand and throwing other ingredients in with your left. So, just because they are using a Coca- Cola bottle, it doesn&rsquo;t mean they&rsquo;re bad &ndash; just efficient. If their bottle is filled with oil that is a golden yellow color and has no debris floating in it, it&rsquo;s generally good to go.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Time your meals around peak dining hours</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you&rsquo;re not familiar with a food street, eat at peak dining times so you can make sure turnover is at its highest. This ensures whatever you&rsquo;re eating is fresh. Never eat something that is pre-cooked and has been sitting out. You should select from raw ingredients and watch the vendor make it fresh before your eyes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Think about what you&rsquo;re eating</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different meats spoil at different rates, so it&rsquo;s good to keep in mind what spoils fastest. Seafood degrades most quickly, followed by poultry. Pork, beef and lamb are the slowest to spoil. Keep in mind larger chunks of meat and fish need more time to reach a consistent temperature throughout, so smaller pieces of meat are less risky. Always make sure any meat is cooked through. A general rule of thumb to keep in mind: never eat raw seafood as street food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Consider cooking techniques &amp;temperatures</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s also a good idea to keep in mind what cooking techniques reach the highest (and thus maximum bacteria-killing) temperatures. Poaching and simmering do not reach boiling point, whereas steaming and boiling are right at 100 ̊C / 212 ̊F. The big flame under the wok when stir-frying reaches about 150 ̊C / 300 ̊F minimum. Deep-frying is even hotter, and grilling has the highest heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Opt for brick &amp; mortar shops</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Since roving vendors can set up shop anywhere, they are not always held accountable for their food safety qualifications. Now we&rsquo;re not saying avoid these at all costs &ndash; sometimes they serve the best food &ndash; but if you have the time to check they are at the same spot daily, then they&rsquo;re trustworthy. Many street carts on wheels are nomadic because they hit up the same streets every day, but they choose the peak times for each corner, such as outside metro stops during rush hour or at night markets after sunset.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Trust the locals</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chinese people try to avoid queuing, so if you see a long line of locals at a vendor (or streetcart), you&rsquo;re pretty much guaranteed to be on to a good thing. See what everyone else is ordering and follow suit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Avoid processed meats</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most food safety scandals in China come out of the processed food industry. Once you get a look at the unnaturally neon pink sausages, you&rsquo;ll understand why to avoid it all costs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Use all of your senses</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sight and smell are just as useful as taste when it comes to checking for spoilage. See a whole fish you want barbecued? Check its eyes are not cloudy and its gills are still red or pink. Smell it. It should smell like the ocean, not fishy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>10. Wash your hands</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of what travelers consider food poisoning actually has nothing to do with the food they are eating, but what they already have on their hands. Make sure you wash your hands before eating (or carry hand sanitizer) and eat with chopsticks. You&rsquo;ll notice that Chinese people rarely touch their food with bare hands &ndash; even in McDonald&rsquo;s, people keep the burger wrapped in its paper wrapper while they eat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>11. Prices can be too good to be true</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>This is a bit tricky if you&rsquo;re not already acquainted with how cheap Chinese street food can be, but it&rsquo;s best thought of as a comparison. Pork costs the same as beef? Definitely not in China. You won&rsquo;t spend over RMB10 for most street food, but just keep in mind certain items (like beef) should cost a bit more, just as they do in your grocery store back home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em><strong>Learn more about street food safety, as well as the best places to eat, cook and drink in Glutton Guide Shanghai: The Hungry Traveler&rsquo;s Guideboo<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>k.

Yes, I&rsquo;m that wide-eyed, amazed person wandering around, probably about to be run over very soon. (I foolishly still think that pedestrians have the right of way on a zebra crossing or pavement). I learnt recently, that this wonder and excitement is the &lsquo;honeymoon&rsquo; phase of culture shock, where new experiences are keeping me on a &lsquo;high&rsquo;, and maintaining a sense of humour helps me cope with dramas that would normally not be as funny or interesting. This will soon morph into the second phase of depression and/or anger, when the &lsquo;reality&rsquo; of life in China will apparently hit me like a giant glob of spit (which thankfully has not happened&hellip;yet).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So before that happens (which I assure you, will knock me <em>straight </em>into the second phase), I feel compelled to share my one-month&rsquo;s worth of observations. After all, what are new experiences if not to be shared, <em>dui?</em></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>You cannot have OCD and live here. </strong>No sir. This is not the place for you. I tell my clean freak/OCD friends (yes I have OCD friends), that if they visit, they should limit their time to less than a week to avoid having a nervous breakdown. Dodging cracks is just the start of it, and I&rsquo;m not just talking about spit as a human by-product on pavements and streets. Also, I cannot afford their medical evacuation to Hong Kong or Singapore (yup I attended <em>that</em> scary medical talk).</li>\r\n	<li><strong>&ldquo;Do not question why&rdquo;. </strong>Err, what&rsquo;s that Socrates? I kid you not, but my husband was <em>right</em> in sagely advising me this. After guffawing for the first ten minutes of our trip to the supermarket (&ldquo;they have Colgate honey, what are you talking about?&rdquo;), I abruptly realised its truth. Colgate was one thing, but &ldquo;<em>Why </em>is there a little boy with no nappy <em>straddling</em> a trolley that people put their food in?&rdquo; And &ldquo;<em>Why</em> are live turtles wrapped in cellophane sticking their poor heads out?&rdquo; &ldquo;<em>Why</em> is there a cucumber the size of our 6-month-old?&rdquo; (I&rsquo;m not sure why this horrified me more than the turtles). &ldquo;Do people not queue? &ldquo;<em>Why</em> would someone send you in the wrong direction rather than tell you they don&rsquo;t know where something is?&rdquo; <em>&ldquo;In China, you don&rsquo;t ask &lsquo;why&rsquo;, you just accept,&rdquo;</em> said the sage. I have now accepted this as my <em>modus operandi</em> for survival.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Angry White Women/ I am a Guest. </strong>After witnessing a Caucasian woman outside Carrefour with bags of groceries and a baby strapped to her body going ballistic that someone had cut her taxi queue, I was immensely grateful I had not brought my 6-month-old with me. (God knows what she would have thought about the cucumber anyway.) As I expressed sympathy for that lady, my companion said <em>&ldquo;Yeah..there are a lot of angry white women here.&rdquo;.</em> I am not sure why I found this comforting (as there was nothing in that statement I could identify with&hellip;I wasn&rsquo;t angry, nor am I white), but I took this to mean that there will be days when you feel like going ballistic when &ldquo;the rules&rdquo; aren&rsquo;t followed. Yet what <em>are</em> the rules? Perhaps things like queuing and the traffic are only understood by westernised civilisations that have had hundreds of years to &lsquo;practice&rsquo; and accept them as a norm. This is opposed to a society that has had mere decades, yet something else is clearly operating given society still functions and traffic still flows. Whatever the case, when the ballistic days happen, I hope to remind myself that I am a guest in this country, a (privileged) observer in this &lsquo;age of China&rsquo; and I really cannot expect my rules to apply. Whilst I try to find out more about the ones that do, I think I would do well to jaywalk in order to avoid being run over.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shirani Alfreds</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Expat mother of two children in Shanghai</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>This article is meant to be a tongue-in-cheek, humorous account of first impressions in China.

With an impressive resume as a diplomat in Beijing, she still finds time to indulge her passion of creativity and children. She has created a company called <strong>My Thingymabob</strong> which turns children&rsquo;s drawings into custom made stuffed toys, bringing children&rsquo;s drawings to life! And being the philanthropist that she is, all proceeds go to charity. Here are 5 things about her new company, inspiration and how you can get a Thingymabob of your very own!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What was your inspiration for this idea?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I have always been amazed at the creativity of children. Their imaginations are limitless and it seems nothing is impossible in their minds. One day I was channeling my inner child and doodling in my notebook during a work meeting (it helps me concentrate, I promise!), and I kept thinking how awesome it would be if my little monster scribble could come to life - into a huge, cuddly plush-toy monster. Then I thought, hang on a second, why not? And that&rsquo;s how My Thingymabob was born.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How did you make it happen?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I started researching and talking to designers, illustrators, seamstresses, tailors - anyone who might know how to turn this idea into reality. It took a few months to get the first prototypes made, using the gorgeous drawings of my friends&rsquo; children who became the pioneering My Thingymabobs. But now I have a team who work together to bring children&rsquo;s drawings to life - one huggable cuddly toy at a time.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why did you decide to donate all the profits to Childfund?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of My Thingymabob&rsquo;s goals and motos is &ldquo;one child&rsquo;s joy being another&rsquo;s survival&rdquo; and I think Childfund helps achieve this goal. I chose Childfund specifically because I have been sponsoring a child in Vietnam through the organization for many years and I couldn&rsquo;t think of a better organization to work through. Childfun is an aid and humanitarian organization that for more than 70 years has been dedicated to working with children, families, and their communities to help them break free from poverty. All profits for 2015 will go to Childfund, and we are hoping to develop our relationship with them even further in 2016.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You have expanded recently! Tell us about it:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Thingymabob now takes children&#39;s drawings and transforms them not only into custom cuddly toys but also into hand-tufted 100% New Zealand wool bespoke rugs.&nbsp;The bespoke rugs come in four different sizes so there&#39;s a rug to suit every&nbsp;room of the home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can people get one of their own?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Parents, grandparents or anyone who finds magic in bringing drawings to life, can visit the website at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.MyThingymabob.com\" target=\"_blank\">www.MyThingymabob.com</a>&nbsp;and send us their child&rsquo;s drawing (or their own!).

Yu Massage offers a range of massage and aromatherapy options, while being immersed in an environment that seems to be taken right out of the Qing Dynasty. Spread out over two floors, Yu Massage has 10 different massage rooms, all looking distinct from one another with both massage beds and large comfy lounge chairs for those opting for a foot massage. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This fall, Yu Massage is offering three different massage packages, each 120 minutes long. The first is the Duet of Yu, which includes a traditional Chinese massage and aroma oil foot massage (RMB240). The second they call the Fly in Dance, including an aroma oil foot and body massage (RMB290). The last is the Marvelous Time, which is a whole 120 minutes concentrated on a full body aroma oil massage &nbsp;(RMB360). &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We opted to try the Fly in Dance, which began with soaking our feet in a wooden bucket of warm water and getting a warm up shoulder rub, followed by a deep foot massage with oil. The second hour we transitioned to the massage bed for a full-body aromatherapy massage, which uses an oil that has a delicate, light scent and is not overpowering. Still offering traditional Chinese massage options, you can have comfort in knowing that you won&rsquo;t receive the teeth-clenching, nerve-pinching massage that you may receive at other places. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We would definitely call this place a steal for the price of a two-hour quality massage. The only catch is that you have to go before 5pm on a weekday to take advantage of this deal. But not to worry &ndash; their usual 60-minute and 90-minute massages range from RMB160-RMB420, so it is still what we would consider to be reasonably priced.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// <a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/2388/yu-massage\">See Listing Here</a>.&nbsp;366 Wuyuan Lu, by Wukang Road 五原路366号，近武康路 (5403 9931)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<h3><a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/13091/green-massage-k11-mall\"><strong>Green Massage</strong></a></h3>\r\n\r\n<p>In an unlikely space, tucked inside the K11 Art Mall on the third floor among restaurants is a spacious spa. Though it may look small from the entrance, this spa is lined with long corridors and generous sized rooms. The rooms are complete with a shower, sink and wall-lined sofa for the customer&rsquo;s convenience and relaxation. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We opted to choose one of their most popular massage treatments &ndash; the purifying lymphatic drainage therapy (RMB616). The name of the massage may be a bit intimidating, but it is certainly one we would go back for again. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The massage combines a detox technique with an essential massage oil to stimulate blood circulation and release waste toxins. It is also meant to improve metabolism and restore balance to one&rsquo;s mental and physical states.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It was a smooth flowing massage as the masseuse worked her way up and down in what seemed to be one continuous motion, all the while using a pressure we were comfortable with. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Although this massage may be their most popular, they offer a wide variety of packages as well starting at RMB458, while their 60-minute Meridian massage is a reasonable RMB348.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// <a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/13091/green-massage-k11-mall\">See Listing Here</a>.

The two services merge with new visitors consulting with on-site doctors for a general checkup.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meridians are checked with results given to spa practitioners, allowing them to cater the treatment to each visitor&rsquo;s unique requirements. While the doctors speak only Chinese, an English consultant is available to help with any translating needs &ndash; book with Candy at 135 0171 8580 or on WeChat at cengong9470.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the consulting is done, visitors can pick from a number of traditional spa treatments. Meridian massages are priced at RMB298 with special packages available by request that include a TCM check-up, a meridian massage or acupuncture session, cupping or scrapping and moxibustion therapy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The treatment was soothing with the dark rings left on our back, a proud mark of the importance of individual pampering. The session ended with a 20-minute<br />\r\nmoxibustion treatment.

Why? Well, not only does the incredible heat go away but the mosquitoes start to die off (DIE DEMON BUGS!), making me a much more comfortable Nicole.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>However, I have to admit that one of my favourite bits of this month is celebrating Halloween! I usually pass on the chocolate and candy collecting because it&rsquo;s not my thing but totally delve deep into the costume making. I love dressing up my kids especially when it&rsquo;s something hard to find so I have to make it (I spent a part of my first year here scouring the Cao&rsquo;An fabric market for it&rsquo;s single scrap of black fun fur for one costume). This year though, since last year&rsquo;s rain made it a bit of a bust, I haven&rsquo;t crafted at all because last year&rsquo;s giant LEGO man costume has still yet to be worn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So I&rsquo;ve been forced to focus my Halloween cheer somewhere else: adult scary things to do around Shanghai! So far I&rsquo;ve only indulged in two on my list, but that is because my husband, despite his confident exterior, is a bit of a pansy and won&rsquo;t even watch the new scary Keanu Reeve&rsquo;s movie with me. What a wuss.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My first stop was the Mr. X puzzle house. Some of you are familiar with this already because who wouldn&#39;t want to spend an awesome evening stuck in a cage with no foreseeable way out and everyone going: &ldquo;No, the clues are wrong! We&rsquo;re not wrong!&rdquo; And though it&rsquo;s definitely not Halloween themed per-say, there are some creepy elements to it. Like the room you stumble into with the skeleton, or the demon symbol on the wall room. I was once left in the demon room by myself once, and normally I&rsquo;m not scared of anything, but I was getting some weird Evil Dead book of the dead vibe going on and very quickly replaced myself with another friend for that task. Whatever. I&rsquo;ve seen the movie. I&rsquo;m not taking any chances.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Second stop was a ghost tour with Newman Tours. I won a voucher at my son&rsquo;s school for being awesome enough to legibly write my name and phone number down on a piece of paper which was then pulled for this prize! My husband and I went last Saturday on a walk around Jing&rsquo;An with our guide David who told us about all of the spooky and scary things apparently lurking around every day Shanghai corners. I actually learned a lot: like did you know Jing&rsquo;An Park was once a cemetery? Well now we both do! I have to admit though the scariest thing on this tour was by far the dark alley he took us down that you weren&#39;t quite so sure was puddled with thrown out water or giant pools of spit. It&rsquo;s easier not to think about it. *shudder*</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Next on my list this weekend is the PuluPulu theme park which I&rsquo;m most excited for. This place is located down by the Shanghai Power Station and is like a permanently Halloween themed Mr. X. They do have puzzle rooms with scary twists but what I&rsquo;m most interested in is the Haunted Hospital! My experience with haunted houses and Ben has not been very good in the past. Mostly he holds me out front at arms length insisting that it&rsquo;s for MY benefit so that I get scared, and not at all to protect his jelly like interior from wetting his pants. This is exactly how I imagine going through the Haunted Hospital will be like with him too, only with more syringes and bloody nurses!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lastly, I plan on visiting Times Grocery where I can take a look at the insane prices of carve-able pumpkins to give myself the biggest fright of all! Seriously - 125RMB!? Is the pumpkin lined with gold inside?!? Will it carve itself? Why is it so expensive!? GAAAAAH.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hope you get outside and have a Happy Halloween too!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '314', '1', '<p>By: Trevor Marshallsea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When it comes to home d&eacute;cor, you can be one of two things: Someone who&rsquo;s serious about home d&eacute;cor, or a parent to small children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The two go together like corn flakes and beer. Bring your baby home from hospital, grow it for a while, and watch your previously stylish and carefully maintained home furnishings &ndash; including purchases like walls and ceilings &ndash;slide into what insurers might call &ldquo;a ceaseless pit of abnormal wear and tear.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Instead, you really should take an 18-year lease on some furniture, then get your real stuff back when your kid flees the by-then very soiled nest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The human life cycle can be charted by the type of stains on your expensive sofa. First comes drool, then &ldquo;mushed teething rusk,&rdquo; then solids (of all kinds), then &ldquo;sticky finger marks&rdquo; (and their companion &ldquo;candy wrappers stuffed down the back&rdquo;). The list progresses up to that rite-of-passage element some parents of teenagers return to after a relaxing weekend away &ndash; alcohol.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A toddler, of course, doesn&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s not right to leave a mark on a sofa. We&rsquo;re talking about someone who thinks it&rsquo;s OK to poop in his pants. The imported fabric on your new three-seater won&rsquo;t be his concern when he&rsquo;s looking for a place to throw up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When our kids were toddlers, we rented a furnished apartment and were relieved to find a beautiful pale leather couch. Food stains, barf and liquids wiped off with ease. Oh, but didn&rsquo;t the ball point pen stand out! I immediately started paying our two-year-old pocket money, just so I could withhold it to pay for the damage.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Probably, then, the smartest home d&eacute;cor tip for parents would be to deck out your home with busy patterns. Amongst our collection of Chinese rugs, we put the busiest-looking one under the dining table. It still looks great; it&rsquo;s just that its pattern has changed &ndash; a lot.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, our walls do not have a busy pattern on them. At least at first they didn&rsquo;t. Now they&rsquo;re white, with bits of gray and brown on them. These bits take the form of children&rsquo;s footmarks above the couch (since when was it a good idea to sit upside-down?) or shoe marks. There&rsquo;s even a shoe mark on the ceiling. When you see things like that, the best reaction is to simply give up.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One day, our kids were banished to the master bedroom while the adults watched some important football. Unknown to us, they took several &ldquo;gel monsters&rdquo; which, it turned out, stuck extremely well to the ceiling. You can still see their multi-colored remnants now, which give sessions of marital pillow talk a sort of comforting &ldquo;indoor play center&rdquo; feel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This issue gets complicated when you&rsquo;re a stay-at-home dad. Usually, we&rsquo;ve invested less emotion into home d&eacute;cor than our wives, at a factor of around zero percent. I did once hold some pretentions in this area until I learned a couple of things most husbands learn:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>1. A husband can <em>umm</em> and <em>aah</em> about home furnishings all he likes, but it doesn&rsquo;t <em>really</em> matter what he thinks. I learned this soon after the stuff purchased during my bachelor days, tastefully I thought, was &ldquo;rearranged&rdquo; &ndash; into a dumpster. I once heard it perfectly expressed when one Ikea trolley-pusher&rsquo;s wife held up two cushions and asked, &ldquo;What do you think?&rdquo; Surprised, the man said: &ldquo;Oh honey, I gave up thinking what I think years ago.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2. If you can learn to say three little words that mean so much, life as a husband improves drastically. These words are &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rdquo; You say them when your better half asks you to blow a Saturday afternoon looking at cushion covers, or something else uninteresting. My wife latterly revealed the reason for the request was not for my input, but to keep her company. But what sort of company is a grumpy man anyway?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t want to live like slobs, mind you. The point is we trust our wives&rsquo; judgment, secure in the knowledge that ours doesn&rsquo;t count. Trouble is, when that judgment is compromised &ndash; by, say, a mouthful of beetroot &ndash; the stay-at-home dad is the one who gets yelled at, just because it happened on our watch! Far more sensible to just yell at the kid, I say. They usually take it in their stride, before tripping and spilling something on the rug.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>//Trevor Marshallsea was a foreign correspondent in Beijing in the 1990s and returned a decade later.

I wondered briefly if I had forgotten to put a mirror in her room (I had), as it was pretty clear to me that she was not. A trip to IKEA solved the mirror problem but then came the next plaintive query, <em>&ldquo;Will I become Chinese when I speak Chinese?&rdquo;</em> Hm. Perhaps I needed a more expensive mirror.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hence began my concern about what we were doing to our children in dragging them around the world with their already mixed (up) cultural identities. I am Singaporean of Sri Lankan origin and my husband is half Dutch and half New Zealander. In our family unit of four, we are of three different nationalities, born in four different countries. In China, our kids are TCK&rsquo;s &ndash; Third Culture Kids (yes, it&rsquo;s a &lsquo;thing&rsquo;!). TCK&rsquo;s are children of parents belonging to two different cultures who live in a third culture. Cultural confusion is part of growing up in this scenario (whether or not you have a mirror) and an identity crisis appears to be inevitable at some point. I just didn&rsquo;t expect it to happen at age 6.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the upside, I observe that if you were to have some sort of crisis (I am planning my mid-life one to happen early next year), there is no better place to indulge it than Shanghai. The jumble of nationalities, the variety and sheer diversity of individuals the city attracts from greater China and the rest of the world is a heady mishmash of craziness anyway. This makes it easier to blend in no matter where you are from or what you are going through, and you can pretend that your inner child is ok despite a screaming internal meltdown. The best part of it all is that nobody judges you for it!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ok, perhaps the &lsquo;no judgement&rsquo; part is delusional, but I am talking about a very basic level whereupon people the world around judge &ndash; the way you look. The question <em>&ldquo;where are you from?&rdquo;</em> if asked of another Chinese person or a foreigner here is genuinely open-ended. This is unlike other societies where the laden implication is that you look or sound different and perhaps don&rsquo;t belong. In Shanghai, it could mean where you were born, what province you moved from, what passport(s) you have, where you have lived the longest or where your parents or ancestors hail from (and I don&rsquo;t mean in the &lsquo;Adam and Eve&rsquo; kind of way). Even if all of the answers to these questions were different, it is accepted.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So why worry about my 6-year-old&rsquo;s confusion in this cultural utopia? She is in good company especially at an international school where more than a few little people seem befuddled about what they are or where they are from. I worry because I want her to know her cultural heritage (at the very least that she is not Chinese simply because she lives in China), and that this doesn&rsquo;t change - ever. I worry less now however, as I look at the little &lsquo;United Nations&rsquo; group of friends she has made and is privileged enough to have here in Shanghai, and I know that they will all eventually learn this. Most importantly, they will find out that in any case, their identities are far more complex and interesting than answering to the world where they come from or where they live.&nbsp;</p>');

Our family restaurant reviewer is here to make some excellent suggestions for you and your kids.</strong></em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Place &amp; Vibe</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the heart of Xintiandi on a Friday night, my husband and I along with our son Kaden (three) arrived with two good friends and their daughters (four and eight), at new restaurant Glasshouse, all in the mood to eat. Entering with our pint-sized diners, we were immediately impressed with the d&eacute;cor, which gives the feeling of a bright and airy greenhouse. Upside down planters filled with foliage hang from the ceiling, and framed tropical butterflies and lush vines provide splashes of color throughout. Picture frames display various butterfly species and skylights filter in soft light, giving such a relaxed and inviting feeling that we immediately felt at ease as we were shown to our table.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Food</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>To begin, we went the predictable route by ordering <strong>French fries</strong> (RMB58) for the little ones in the hopes of staving off hunger, boredom and certain anarchy. The fries that came to the table however, were by no means typical. These super crispy fries were nestled in a miniature fryer basket, and the kids really enjoyed the side of truffle butter. Next we ordered <strong>lime and lemongrass chicken wings</strong> (RMB58) with shrimp sambal sauce. They had a tangy citrus flavor and were the perfect pairing to the fries. Lastly we ordered <strong>pink rice paper</strong> <strong>rolls</strong> (RMB78) filled with smoked salmon, prawn and herbs. The kids were not interested in trying this particular dish, but the adults at the table certainly appreciated it, particularly the delicious accompanying white balsamic sauce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"noodles\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/newsletter/151104/Glasshouse-2.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Appetites now piqued, the kids decided on <strong>macaroni and cheese </strong>(RMB88), <strong>spaghetti volcano</strong> (RMB88) and <strong>cheese pizza</strong> (RMB98). I was a little concerned that they may be disappointed when their pasta selections arrived, assuming they would prefer instead, more &lsquo;traditional&rsquo; and familiar noodles. Much to my surprise they devoured the &lsquo;volcano&rsquo; spaghetti, and other than noting &ldquo;too much butter&rdquo; in the macaroni and cheese (pointed out by our oldest diner Julia, age 8), they loved the sausage that was baked inside. As for us adults, we tried the <strong>Singapore noodles</strong> (RMB158), a signature dish at Glasshouse and for good reason. They were downright delicious and full of flavor &ndash; infused with red lobster, Serrano ham, goose liver and homemade curry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"dessert\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/newsletter/151104/Glasshouse-3.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>After, the children settled on the <strong>white chocolate fondue</strong> (RMB88) for dessert and were thrilled when the fruits, brownies, marshmallows, and deliciously light, airy egg puffs arrived. Another fun dessert option is the <strong>Candy Crush ice cream </strong>(RMB88), served with Oreo cookies, candy and Rice Crispies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Kid Approved</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Despite the East-meets-West fusion, the children in our party enjoyed these distinctly flavorful dishes. While there is no children&rsquo;s menu, the adult menu has acceptable options and portion sizes for little diners (although probably not recommendable for under 3s, who may require a simpler children&rsquo;s menu, booster chair, change table or children&rsquo;s cutlery).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The staff were very accommodating with our children, recommending fun dishes and drinks and even bringing their beverages in mini pitchers with straws, which the kids absolutely adored.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Overall, the evening was a huge success with the adults enjoying a relaxing glass of wine (the drinks list is extensive) as well as a delicious meal. This is an excellent family friendly option in the heart of Xintiandi with affordable pricing parents will appreciate, and appropriate portion sizing both adults and children can enjoy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Price:</strong> RMB170 per person, including children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Recommended ages: </strong>5 and up</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Good for: </strong>lunch, casual dinner and fusion food.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"family\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/newsletter/151104/siobhan.jpg\" style=\"width:50%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em>Join Siobhan&rsquo;s family in the next issue of </em>Urban Family<em> as we go on the hunt for kid-friendly dining options around town!</em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// Lane 181, Taicang Lu, Xintiandi, Bldg 7, 1/F, near Madang Lu 太仓路181弄新天地7号楼1楼, 近马当路 (3307 0388)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '322', '1', '<p>So you&rsquo;ve just moved in and finally got your shipment so you know exactly what you&rsquo;re missing in your home, or maybe you&rsquo;ve been here for a bit but want to fill up those empty nooks and crannies that are just begging for a decorative piece. Either way, you know you have the itch to shop for some decor to go with your Shanghai lifestyle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So what does that mean exactly? Well from my experiences that means buying as many Chinese things as you can and ramming them into your home. Even if that ramming is into the smallest pigeon hole possible, we can always find a reason why that giant Buddha head was the best buy ever because it was on sale and it fits perfectly in that corner. Or, it means buying little things to fill up counters, and even littler things to fit inside the little things! You want a ginger jar? WHY NOT BUY 5?!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With prices being relatively cheap on many things here we all can get a little carried away. And I speak about this from the heart as I stare upon my tea shelf crammed with zodiac figures for the family, tea jars, and succulent plants that I&rsquo;ve managed to kill, again. We&rsquo;ve all been there - on the antique market strip, in Yuyuan, or on Taobao, thinking, &ldquo;Yes! That will look perfect on my shelf/countertop/credenza (I&rsquo;m not even sure what a credenza is&hellip;).&rdquo; And then you realize suddenly that you have no more space&hellip;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yes, you live in shanghai and Chinese decor is pretty rad. I really want a giant round tea shelf with many levels and drawers on the bottom. It will look amazing holding all of the pictures I currently have sitting in frames on my dining room table instead of the wall where they were supposed to go, more half-dead succulent plants, and so much dust my Ayi will probably quit on me in two days. However, I know if I buy my dream shelf that all I will end up getting is an expensive antique climbing structure for my two boys as they try to navigate their way up to the ceiling.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>So how exactly do you decorate your home then? Well, I have a few tips for you:</p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>Think of the space you&rsquo;re buying before you buy. I&rsquo;m notorious for buying things that&rsquo;ll fit SOMEWHERE but then turns out that somewhere doesn&rsquo;t exist (I lied I totally, have three vases sitting on the floor of my spare shower). And try not to clutter your home. There is only a few inches between being a master decorator and a total hoarder - don&rsquo;t cross that line. Okay&hellip;there may be four vases&hellip;</li>\r\n	<li>You will be tempted to go all out on the Chinese decor, and although it may seem like a great idea now, chances are when you&rsquo;re ready to repatriate or move those things won&rsquo;t fit into the style of your next home. Sure, a terracotta warrior looks awesome in your backyard NOW, but take that back to the States or Germany and put it in the front yard. Yea&hellip;you&rsquo;re now all of a sudden the same people that had those giant white lions on the porch that you used to make fun of. It&rsquo;s gonna be weird.</li>\r\n	<li>Focus on just a few pieces you REALLY love and that you know will fit great in your house or your next place. A piece of art, a really great credenza (seriously what is that?), or an unique antique are perfect things to travel with you and not make you feel like once your home you&rsquo;re still living in Shanghai - instead these few unique pieces will remind you of the awesome time you had while here living abroad.</li>\r\n	<li>Remember that everything you buy isn&#39;t going to make the next trip with you. Keep in mind that at the end of your contract, most of those awesome things you&rsquo;ll have to part with on a WeChat selling group or Facebook group and at a fraction of the cost you spent on it. Trust me, I&rsquo;m in a WeChat group of 414 members who buy/sell things and those ladies are RUTHLESS with prices. So if you spent 2000RMB on an awesome Buddha head you better believe that you&rsquo;re not selling that for more than 200RMB, but really 150RMB because I don&#39;t really need it but I&rsquo;m doing you a favour taking it off your hands.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, buying things to decorate your home here can be super fun - especially if you find the great finds at the back of some crazy back alley antique shop. Things like that make the whole experience here worth it. Plus, how many of us in the world get to move to a new country every few years and get to decorate a whole new place?

INSERT INTO `th_contents` VALUES ('1', '1', '328', '1', '<p>By: April Rixon</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With winter now upon us, and the sun only making the rare appearance in the greying skies, attention to good nutrition is more vital now than at any other time of year. These next few months bring with them not only the risk of Seasonal Affective Disorder (SADS), but the risk of Vitamin D deficiency as well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All year round, the sun (when not blocked by fog and smog) provides us with Vitamin D, which aids immune function, reduces inflammation and regulates phosphate levels in the body. Most importantly, the body requires Vitamin D for the absorption of calcium. As we all know, calcium is what makes our teeth and bones strong and healthy. A lack of Vitamin D increases the risk of diseases such as rickets in children and osteoporosis in adults.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Different countries have different Recommended Daily Allowances (RDA) for Vitamin D, but the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) at the Institute of Medicine of The National Academies recommends an intake of 600 units per day for adults, 400 for babies up to one year of age and 700 for the elderly. RDA increases for those that are either pregnant or breastfeeding, as well as people of African, African-Caribbean or South Asian descent. People that are not regularly exposed to sunlight because of their lifestyle (i.e. office workers) or environment (i.e. city dwellers) are particularly susceptible to suffering from a Vitamin D deficiency.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The biggest challenge is that there are very few natural food sources for Vitamin D, and getting a sufficient amount from diet alone requires meticulous meal planning. Luckily for us, many foods are now fortified with various vitamins and minerals, although it varies by location and brand. Be sure to always read the labels, and stay informed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most food sources of Vitamin D are found in non-vegetarian foods. Cereal, orange juice, milk, yoghurt and baby foods are the most commonly fortified. One of the best sources is salmon, which contains a whopping 450 units in a single 3 ounce serving. Canned tuna fish, swordfish, entire sardines and eggs with the yolks are also great options. Mushrooms are the perfect vegetarian alternative to fish, but only if you choose the right ones. Just like humans, mushrooms produce Vitamin D when exposed to sunlight, but nowadays most are grown in the dark. However, there are some specific brands that are grown in ultraviolet light, such as Dole&rsquo;s Portobello Mushrooms that contain 400 units per cup.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vitamin D is a fat-soluble vitamin: it needs fat to be able to be absorbed by the body. Maybe it&rsquo;s no coincidence then that it&rsquo;s found in fatty fish. Cook mushrooms in olive oil and take multi-vitamins containing good fats, like nuts and avocado, with meals. Getting your nutrients from a clean and balanced diet is best, but cod liver oil or Vitamin D supplements or drops are good alternatives as well, especially for children that are picky eaters. As always, if you&rsquo;re planning to change your diet or take supplements, consult with your doctor first.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&gt;To learn more about health and wellness topics, visit <a href=\"http://www.natures-nosh.com/\">www.natures-nosh.com</a>.</p>'), ('1', '1', '329', '1', '<p>Thanks to some of our partners in the animal rights and adoption community, we will feature a handful of loveable pets who are up for adoption every month!&nbsp;There are so many animals in Shanghai that are in need of a caring family and home, and these are only a few who need help.

We asked Ina Schroeder and Senem Cennetoglu, two devoted animal lovers living in Shanghai, how we can help them. They&rsquo;ve been involved with animal welfare organizations, charity events and volunteer work for over 3 years. They tell us conditions for animals in Shanghai are more dramatic than most of us would ever anticipate. So if you walk by an animal in need, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to take action. The ones left behind may be facing a fearful future.&nbsp;Here are 5 ways you can help improve the life of a stray animal in Shanghai:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>1. Remove them from the streets</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The first act is as simple as picking them up. Approach them slowly and cautiously. Speak in a calm, gentle voice, and use food to gain their trust. It is better to use a leash for dogs, and have a pet carrier ready in case the cat/dog doesn&rsquo;t like to be held. The immediate needs of a rescue pet are very minimal and basic. Provide a small, contained and safe space, food, water, a litter box and lots of love. Even just this should be enough for a couple of days. It is of course highly recommended to do a check up with a vet to make sure your rescue is healthy and free of worms, fleas and mites. If such is the case, these infestations are easily treated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>2. Become a foster parent</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you can&rsquo;t commit to adopting a pet for life, you can still help by providing a temporary home as a foster parent. Becoming a foster family saves more lives than adoption itself. A foster family can accommodate multiple rescues temporarily, and doesn&rsquo;t hold the pressure of a lifelong commitment. Although it sounds like less work, foster families have their own duties. They look after the wellbeing of the animal, get involved pet adoption social media/ channels, prepare and post signs, adds, fliers and help their rescues find a permanent home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-size:16px\">3. Add a new member to your family</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You might enjoy your little fellow more than you think, but the ultimate goal is to find them a permanent home. There are several adoption agencies and pet charity organizations that commit their time and efforts to rescue abandoned pets and help provide necessary health care. Schroeder and Cennetoglu do not recommend buying an animal from a pet shop or breeder, as these animals are often exploited in order to make a profit. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>4. Trap, neuter, return!</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you don&rsquo;t have the space or time to take care of a pet even for a brief time, there are other ways you can help. Neutered animals help keep the population under control, eliminating competition for mating and food. Fewer animals will get hurt, which means fewer infections or diseases. Many individuals are voluntarily performing TNR. All you need is a humane box trap and a controlled environment. Most of the residential compounds in Shanghai have security guards. You can communicate with your management or neighbors and leave your trap outside for an hour with some food as bait. Before you know it, you will have a very scared stray trapped. Many local veterinarians provide substantial discounts for stray cat spay/neutering in Shanghai. The operation itself is usually quite simple, especially for male cats. With the right antibiotics, you can even release the animals back to their environment after couple of hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>5. Become a part of a community of kind, like-minded animal lovers</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Joining the cause of animal welfare comes with some human friends as well. Activities can include raffles, quiz nights and foster and adoption events with people all united to save animal lives. &ldquo;All of our efforts are towards a natural, safe and happy existence, not only for ourselves but all the life around us,&rdquo; says Cennetoglu . &ldquo;Join the cause! The pleasure of seeing your rescue or foster years after with their forever family is priceless.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#A52A2A\"><strong><em>Contacts:</em></strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><em><span style=\"color:#A52A2A\">For information on fostering or adoption, check out: </span><a href=\"http://www.scaashanghai.org/\"><span style=\"color:#A52A2A\">www.scaashanghai.org</span></a><span style=\"color:#A52A2A\">, www.bestfriendschina.org, </span><a href=\"http://www.jargroup.doodlekit.com/\"><span style=\"color:#A52A2A\">www.jargroup.doodlekit.com</span></a></em></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#A52A2A\"><strong><em>Think Adoption Animal Rescue.

Well, that was, at least, till Apothecary 10/10 opened shops in Jing&rsquo;An Kerry Centre and Grand Gateway 66. A Taiwanese import, the sleek, bright emporium &ndash; which is beautifully designed and has a clean, glossy spa-like feel to it &ndash; boasts an amazing edit of body must-haves and classic skin-care essentials, stocking both indie fragrances, candles and cosmetics brands &ndash; hello The Laundress and Eve Lom&nbsp; as well as more &lsquo;famous&rsquo; names like Diptyque, Malin + Goetz and Marvis. New brands, niche and non, are set to be introduced each month, making this a truly unique spot for beauty hoarders wanting to eschew Sephora&rsquo;s sometimes overwhelming array of products galore. Pretty much every line in store is higher-end, so expect to pay premium prices, but we firmly believe that anything that goes on your skin should be of the best quality &ndash; and in that sense, 10/10 Apothecary nails it.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>&gt;&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/18267/1010-apothecary\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 122, 183); text-decoration: none !important; background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_self\"><em>Jing&#39;an Kerry Centre location</em></a><em>,&nbsp;</em><a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/18268/10-10-apothecary-grand-gateway\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 122, 183); text-decoration: none !important; background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_self\"><em>Grand Gateway location</em></a><em>, (</em><a href=\"http://www.1010apothecary.com.cn/\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; color: rgb(51, 122, 183); text-decoration: none !important; background-color: transparent;\" target=\"_blank\"><em>www.1010apothecary.com.cn</em></a><em>)</em></p>\r\n\r\n<div>\r\n<hr />\r\n<h2><img alt=\"zurita\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/img/newsletter/151125/zurita.jpg\" style=\"height:450px; width:50%\" /></h2>\r\n\r\n<h2>Zurita&nbsp;</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>Sustainable fashion is a concept we&rsquo;re fully behind.

With my brand &ndash; and my shop &ndash; I want to change that.&rdquo; Made with all-natural fibers and fabrics like bamboo, cashmere and silk, each piece on sale at Zurita is indeed incredibly affordable. Ultra soft silk tops start around RMB300, while a cashmere coat &ndash; the most expensive item in store &ndash; is priced at just over RMB1,000. Blending practical and flattering, dresses show form fitting, stretched silhouettes, while trousers incline towards the easy and comfortable.

Such traits are mirrored in the collection, which, from the few campaign images released for it, shows sharp-shouldered jackets and military detailing. It&rsquo;s good stuff, and under the leadership of the brand&rsquo;s 29-year-old creative director Olivier Rousteing, it&rsquo;s set to be a hit among label fans who can&rsquo;t afford the real thing. We&rsquo;re into the more simple pieces: the black leather backpack, the suede high-tops and that killer military coat for men, the ruched skirt and velvet jacket-dress for the ladies. A few pieces are uncannily similar to looks from Balmain&rsquo;s Autumn/Winter collections seen over the last three years, which, again, is going to make many of us &lsquo;commoners&rsquo; quite happy. Prices aren&rsquo;t super purse-friendly, but hey, it&rsquo;s Balmain, baby. The line hits stores and H&amp;M&rsquo;s digital platforms on November 5.

He tells us about the realities of air pollution in China and why having a good air purifier is a necessity to have in your home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">1. &nbsp;HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE FOR BAD AIR TO IMPACT YOUR HEALTH?</span></strong><br />\r\n<br />\r\n&ldquo;When I was last in Beijing, pollution was at the hazardous level: Every hour of exposure reduced my life expectancy by 20 minutes. It&rsquo;s as if every man, woman and child smoked 1.5 cigarettes each hour.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This statement, made by Richard Muller, scientific director of Berkeley Earth, a group devoted to climate science and strategic analysis, says it all.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air pollution is a serious environmental problem, with serious detrimental effects to your health. There&rsquo;s no time like the present to take action in protecting your health, even if you&rsquo;ll only be in China for a brief period.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>2. SO HOW BAD IS BAD?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to a study conducted by the World Health Organization, between April 5, 2014 and Aug 5, 2015, 92 percent of China&rsquo;s population experienced at least 120 hours of unhealthy air.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That same article states that over 4,000 people die in China <em>per day</em> due to health complications resulting from air pollution. Tiny air particles referred to as PM2.5 can trigger heart attacks, strokes, lung cancer and asthma. Air pollution is not a matter to take lightly.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Additionally, the National Institute of Health (NIH) states that lung cancer is a leading cause of death in China. In Western nations, the likely culprit is smoking. However, according to a study published in 2013, while 67% of Chinese males smoked, only 4% of women did, and while smoking contributes to 75% of male lung cancer in China, it contributes to only 18% of female lung cancer. This leaves 82% to other factors.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"Pollution in China\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/pollution.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>3. OKAY, THE AIR OUTSIDE IS BAD, BUT INDOOR AIR SHOULD BE BETTER, RIGHT?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unfortunately, there aren&rsquo;t any boundaries when it comes to air pollution. Outside air can become trapped inside the home and continuously recirculate throughout the space. The NIH suggests that indoor air pollution is actually suspected to play a heavy role in the development of lung cancer.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here&rsquo;s a quick example: If it&#39;s registering a concentration of 100ug/m3 of PM 2.5 outdoors, you could easily find your living room at 50ug/m3. The maximum threshold of PM2.5 intake in a 24-hour period according to WHO (World Health Organization) guidelines is 25ug/m3. That should really put our concept of &ldquo;clean air&rdquo; in perspective.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>4. IT SOUNDS LIKE INDOOR AIR PURIFIERS ARE A NECESSITY, BUT IS ONE ENOUGH?</strong></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>One air purifier, no matter how beastly, typically only covers the room that you&rsquo;ve placed it in.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Air purifiers are much like air conditioners: you need one for every room in your home. Just as you wouldn&rsquo;t try to cool down your whole home with one fan, you can&rsquo;t expect to clean the air in your whole home with one purifier. Bigger isn&rsquo;t better; you need a wide range of coverage, which means putting multiple purifiers in multiple rooms.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\">5. FOR AIR PURIFIERS TO WORK EFFECTIVELY, HOW OFTEN DO FILTERS NEED TO BE CHANGED?</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Depending on air quality conditions, filters can last anywhere from three to six months. Some boxes might advertise that filters can last up to a year without being changed, but it is more likely that these claims are inaccurate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Filter efficiency decreases over time, and when your filter reaches capacity it is unable to capture particles drawn through, rendering it completely useless.</p>\r\n\r\n<hr />\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SO WHAT&rsquo;S THE EASIEST WAY TO MAINTAIN GOOD AT HOME &lsquo;AIR CARE&rsquo;?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Enter Mila, the world&rsquo;s first smart air purifier system available through monthly service plans with filters delivered to your door. Air quality can be monitored in every room through an app on your phone, so even when you&rsquo;re not home, you can check in to make sure family members are breathing clean.

This is hardly a surprise as <em>feng shui</em> is incredibly complex and mysterious in nature and intention. Over time it has developed and progressed into different schools and areas of application. However, if you are able to immerse yourself in the art and embrace its ideology, it can not only improve your home, but alter your life for the better.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The term <em>feng shui</em> literally means &ldquo;wind&rdquo; and &ldquo;water,&rdquo; and is all about balancing one&rsquo;s environment in order to bring good karma to your life (or company if it practiced in an office). The fundamentals of <em>feng shui</em> revolve around the relationship between five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal and water. All of these elements affect different areas of one&rsquo;s life. <em>Feng shui</em> has developed as a lifestyle that brings harmony to one&rsquo;s life and home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>The History of Feng Shui</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>Feng shui</em> is an ancient discipline that began in China thousands of years ago. It was originally used to identify safe dwellings that would allow farmers&rsquo; crops to flourish and also to determine appropriate burial sites for deceased relatives. As the years went by, it developed into a way to identify suitable locations for palaces, monuments and even entire cities, so that they could thrive and prosper. Although its popularity has waxed and waned over the years, <em>feng shui</em> has always been an integral part of Chinese culture. Today, it is used across the globe for interiors, predictions, and even bettering one&rsquo;s business or karma, but it will always treasure its Chinese roots.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shanghai offers a plain example of <em>feng shui</em>. One of the most well-known stories about<em> feng shui</em>&rsquo;s influen<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a>ce in Shanghai is the dragon pillar at the crossroads of Yan&#39;an Zhong Lu and Chengdu Lu, which serves as the central connection point of the city&rsquo;s main south-north and east-west highways. Builders and engineers worked on the construction of the highway in the early 1990s, when they ran into a problem connecting the two highways at the center point &ndash; they were unable to properly dig a foundation for the largest pillar. Technical engineers and experts from all over the world tried everything they could think of to get the pillar far enough into the ground, but still nothing worked. They finally decided to seek advice from a monk at Longhua Temple who was well versed in <em>feng shui</em>. He identified the &ldquo;dragon vein&rdquo; at the center as the problem and explained that nine dragons must be placed on the pillar in order to counteract the dragon that existed underneath. At first no one believed him because the explanation was so unscientific; however, they were able to dig the foundation after heeding his advice and today we can still see the golden dragon pillar under the Yan&#39;an Lu highway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"5 elements\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/feng-shui.jpg\" style=\"height:320px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Seeking Advice</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a better understanding of <em>feng shui</em>, Mr. Yuan Feng is your man. A <em>feng shui</em> consultant at Shanghai Pathways, Yuan has been consulting across China for over a decade. Although he mainly offers his expertise for private homes, both local and international companies have turned to him for consultations so as to improve their karma, wealth or knowledge in an industry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When appraising someone&rsquo;s home, a consultant or master will use antique tools to assist them in directional methods, since the north, south, east and west are key to the fundamentals of <em>feng shui</em>. Yuan is only able to reveal the basics of his trade as the rest are kept secret and never revealed. It is very important for clients to believe in <em>feng shui</em>, or else they will not be able to participate in the consultation. For example, Yuan explains, &ldquo;In the traditional way, if the client is a couple and the wife does not believe in <em>feng shui</em>, and they are both present for the consultation, the wife has to drink a cup of wine and hold it for the entire process, so that she is unable to say anything that is not good luck.&rdquo; It is essential to always bring luck and good karma upon the home and to exhibit decorum.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yuan believes that families in particular can benefit from the art of<em> feng shui</em> in their homes. It can help the essence of a home; however, it cannot solve all the complex problems of a family. &ldquo;We believe that<em> feng shui</em> is part of the solution, but still you need to work together as a family in order to have good outcomes,&rdquo; he explains. By altering the positioning of their room and bed in the home, <em>feng shui </em>can also help couples improve fertility if they are trying to start a family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In recent years <em>feng shui </em>has grown increasingly popular in China and consultants are widely available. However, Yuan cautions that one must be careful when hiring a <em>feng shui</em> consultant or master. &ldquo;There are few people who really can access the true information and techniques, so there are frauds in the field. In the past development of the <em>feng shui</em> technique, there have been gaps and breaks, so you don&rsquo;t get the right information if you don&rsquo;t follow a true teacher.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>What You Can Do in Your Home</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>When buying a new home, a road should never lead directly to your front door as this brings bad luck.&nbsp; The road in front of your home should also not curve in a semi-circle away from your front door.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Your apartment should not neighbor a building that is made completely of glass. The glass from the next-door building will reflect into your home and this also brings bad luck.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>A mirror in the bedroom should never face directly towards the bed, nor should one face directly towards a door in the bathroom.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>The front door should also never be placed directly in front of the end of a stairwell.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Do not have fake flowers in your home; everything should bring real life into your home.</strong></li>\r\n	<li><strong>Every home has a different directional system that is associated with a meaning, such as wealth, love or wisdom.

And if you don&rsquo;t, you seriously live in some sort of cave right? Seriously.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone has WeChat in China and it&rsquo;s the fourth biggest messaging app in the world behind WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger (which, let&rsquo;s face it, should have just stayed where it belonged in the Facebook app) and QQ Mobile (also a Chinese app).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, WeChat is becoming so recognized it was actually the featured app on the launch of the Apple iWatch - which I really want but someone&rsquo;s husband won&rsquo;t buy it for her! I need that watch. I need it for life!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Anyway, many hours of my day is consumed by WeChat. It, and it&rsquo;s many groups I&rsquo;ve found myself in, are my main source of entertainment while I fight with my VPN to load Facebook. Everything happens on WeChat: get togethers, craft circles, buying and selling, school class groups - LIFE! Not being on WeChat and hearing about all the stuff that goes down on it will give you a serious case of FOMO (fear of missing out) and that alone will be enough for you to download the app or find a reason for you to buy a new smartphone so you can download the app!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s even really helpful with your Ayi or Driver or anyone that doesn&rsquo;t understand what you&rsquo;re talking about when all you want is something picked up at the store. Because of it&rsquo;s awesome internal translator button you don&rsquo;t have to rely on an extra translator app to get your message across to the right people. And of course its not perfect: I once used it to ask a clerk where the cereal was and he showed me flour; it&rsquo;s good enough in a pinch.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, of all the awesome features that WeChat has (animated stickers for the win!) there was one feature I was trying my hardest to avoid - WeChat Wallet. This new feature brought out a while ago basically acts as a digital wallet that allows you to transfer easily to another friend, or a vendor, or even Carrefour. I was waiting in line today at Carrefour behind a woman who was lazily staring at her phone while the cashier scanned her groceries and she (also lazily) showed him her QR code on her phone and walked away with her groceries. It was that easy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>And that was and still is my biggest problem with WeChat wallet - the fact that it is TOO easy. I recently joined this gigantic buy/sell group of 400+ members all over Shanghai because I realized I had a LOT of baby stuff that was all really good quality that I needed to get rid of. I was on a buy/sell group in my local area but the stuff wasn&#39;t moving fast enough out of my house. So, when I joined the group I never thought that I would all of a sudden be faced with people who not only wanted to send me instant payments, but also wanted items delivered to them! The requests for my Alipay and WeChat wallet payments were so fierce and overwhelming that I just had to give into it. And now, I have a good lump sum from what I sold to other ladies burning a digital hole into my pocket!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I learned that my fake lulu lemon lady will just send me pictures of the things I like and kuaidi it to my house with a simple WeChat wallet payment. My jewelry lady will do the same with the latest Cartier necklace - directly from the factory to my door. I don&#39;t even have to go to the market to haggle on it anymore!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I can also send a payment to the lady who makes cupcakes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cupcakes. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m in so much trouble.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In my life with so much going on with the kids and school, I&rsquo;m quite happy for the convenience of things like WeChat and WeChat wallet, but a part of me yearns for the simplicity of face-to-face transactions. Yes, it&rsquo;s more effort. Yes, you have to leave the house and put on a bra. And yes, it takes time, but that is time interacting with an actual person and not a digital avatar and that has to be worth something right? And I&rsquo;m sure my husband would be the first one to tell you that anything that helps me spend money more easily is the DEVIL&rsquo;S TOOL. I don&rsquo;t think he even knows I have this activated on my app&hellip;he&rsquo;ll probably take my phone away.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But until that happens I&rsquo;m just going to sit here braless and order cupcakes. CAUSE IT&rsquo;S SO EASY!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>xoNiki</p>'), ('1', '1', '350', '1', '<p>By: Trevor Marshallsea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Christmas is a time of giving. And, though my mum told me not to mention this, it&rsquo;s not physically possible to have &ldquo;giving&rdquo; without &ldquo;receiving.&rdquo; It&rsquo;s also a time of eating and drinking. It&rsquo;s a time of families getting together and, perhaps despite that, of being merry.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most of all, though, it&rsquo;s a time of pressure. When you&rsquo;re a kid, having made or bought some presents for others, you essentially turn up, open your presents and stuff your face. But Christmas reflects life in that the older you get, the more pressure it involves.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you reach maturity, you&rsquo;ll feel that pressure to buy a suitably impressive gift for your special someone. Once, when I lived in London, my girlfriend had three dozen of my favorite food &ndash; oysters &ndash; specially flown in from France for me. After they arrived I duly handed over her present: precisely four bars of soap. Oh and I shouldn&rsquo;t forget &ndash; a card. That was a lesson in how to suck at Christmas. But at least she also got a gift that would last forever: an anecdote about lousy boyfriends. And I&rsquo;ll plead it&rsquo;s not as bad as some of the other anecdotes out there, involving stepladders, an electric drill, a voucher for a camping store, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When you get older still, and become a parent, the pressure peaks. Mostly, there&rsquo;s pressure to get your stories straight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We have kids, we make noble pledges that we will never, ever, lie to them. And then we tell them there&rsquo;s a fat, ageless man who inhabits the uninhabitable, and that every December 24 he achieves the impossible &ndash; by flying around the whole flipping planet with his magical reindeer, giving presents to everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Even if you take out all the Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, voodoo-ists, etc., who don&rsquo;t do Christmas, that&rsquo;s still an immensely steep delivery mission. On one hand, it&rsquo;s no wonder Santa does bugger-all for the rest of the year. On the other, it&rsquo;s just a very hard fable to sustain for kids whose most influential mode of travel involves not flying reindeer but an information superhighway.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My scientific wife isn&rsquo;t a fan of Santa. This heartens me whenever I&rsquo;m in her bad books (&ldquo;It&rsquo;s OK. She boos Santa Claus too,&rdquo; I say) but it did lead to debate about whether we should perpetuate the Santa story with our two girls. In the end we did, probably because, unlike the bloke whose birthday Christmas celebrates, Santa really is everywhere these days and impossible to escape. It is kind of like that creepy song coming true, about Him knowing when you&rsquo;re sleeping or awake, and precisely how you&rsquo;ve been behaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That decision taken &ndash; with some gifts to be credited to Santa and the rest from us &ndash; the pressure was on to build the, err, lie. Since we live in a Beijing apartment, I made &ldquo;footprints&rdquo; out of talcum powder for the snowy effect, all the way from the front door to our tree. I left a note, written in my left hand, thanking the girls for the cookies and beer. At least those had been genuinely scoffed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That exercise delighted the girls, but proved two things: 1. Talcum powder can take up to a whole day to vacuum up. 2. You need a story for how Santa gets into a locked apartment. (Thankfully our girls were little, so my effort of &ldquo;Umm, aah, magic!&rdquo; did the trick.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The following year I got creative, and left puddles of water, for melted snow, on the floor. With Beijing&rsquo;s heating turned up to 11, these had evaporated by Christmas morning. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad Santa tried to be more tidy this year!&rdquo; I said, and the girls&rsquo; suspicions also evaporated.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next year we got tripped up. We were skiing in Canada for Christmas, and took our wrapped presents with us from Beijing. We secreted them in corners of our luggage that the girls would never find, and when they duly found them, several days before Christmas, an interrogation started &ndash; of us, by them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;How come the presents are already here when it&rsquo;s three days before Santa comes?&rdquo; they said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Um, we knew we&rsquo;d be going to Canada, so we had Santa drop them off in Beijing early,&rdquo; I said, adding, for full Christmas wonder, that it necessitated a special shipping and handling fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Phew. They were satisfied again (they really weren&rsquo;t that bright back then). But, like a criminal on the run, I knew our time was almost up. A few months later, our six and five year olds asked me, suspiciously, if Santa really did exist. Without hesitating, I assured them that he most certainly did not. Some parents might mourn a loss of innocence. I just felt relief. I&rsquo;ve known some people who&rsquo;ve sustained the myth until their kids were 11 and nine. Sod that. I&rsquo;d consider that hard work, or what Al Gore might call &ldquo;An Inconvenient Lie.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Still, some confusion about Christmas lingered. Two years later, in our secular household, I had to explain its origin to our seven-year-old youngest.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s terrible!&rdquo; she cried, to my visible bafflement. &ldquo;If Jesus&rsquo; birthday was on Christmas Day, he&rsquo;d only get one present a year!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At least, mixed up somewhere in that mix up, there was something of the notion of giving.</p>'), ('1', '1', '351', '1', '<p><strong>A big, juicy cut of steak for the table is a well-earned luxury during the holidays, but cooking at home can often seem daunting. Jason Oakley of <a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/17839/coquille_1\">Coquille Bistro</a> and <a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/11255/scarpetta\">Scarpetta</a> knows a thing or two about steak from his days as head chef of the Mandarin Oriental&rsquo;s <a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/shanghai/directory/10515/fifty8-degree-grill-mandarin-oriental-hotel\">Fifty8<sup>o</sup> Grill Steakhouse</a>; here&rsquo;s his advice for cooking bigger cuts with panache.</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>At the store:</strong></span> I opt for thick, bone-in cuts like a large rib eye or <em>c&ocirc;te de boeuf</em> around the holiday season. My rule of thumb is that the smaller the beef, the easier it is to screw up so don&rsquo;t be afraid of larger cuts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>If using frozen beef: </strong></span>Good quality frozen beef is fine for home cooking, but defrost it properly for 48 hours in the fridge, and not under water.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>On salt:</strong> </span>Invest in proper sea salt. Not iodized or table salt. We use Maldon at our restaurants (and you can find it on Taobao).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>Temper, temper:</strong></span> Don&rsquo;t take it out the chiller and straight into the frying pan, allow it to temper by sitting at room temperature for 25-30 minutes depending on size.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>Seasoning</strong>: </span>Aggressively season your steak with sea salt and coarse black pepper. Do not use powdered pepper. The steak should have a good crust of salt and pepper, especially if your cut is particularly thick.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>Pan and oil:</strong> </span>Find the heaviest-bottomed frying pan you have.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Season it with olive, groundnut oil, or anything with a particularly high burn point. Don&rsquo;t use butter (yet), avocado or pumpkin oil.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>Cooking:</strong></span> Heat your pan to just before smoking point, being careful of oil splatters. Once in the pan, leave it alone for four minutes (two minutes or less for one-inch steaks) and allow the Maillard reaction to do the rest. Resist temptation to poke, turn, check or otherwise fiddle with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"steak\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/Coquille-Cote-du-Beouf_.jpg\" style=\"height:325px; width:600px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>Flip it:</strong></span> As you flip it to the other side and are halfway into searing time, put in some crushed garlic, rosemary and lots of butter. We tie our herbs together with twine for easy removal. Once the butter hits the pan it will brown quickly, which is good. Baste the steak frequently.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong><em>C&ocirc;te de boeuf</em></strong><strong> oven finish:</strong></span> After searing, put the whole steak in a preheated 200-degree oven. Transfer to a lined baking tray if your panhandle is plastic or wood. Cook for 20-25 minutes, or until the steak has an internal temperature of 50-54 degrees (for medium rare). C&ocirc;te de boeuf and bone-in rib eye only.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"color:#FF8C00\"><strong>Rest up:</strong></span> Remove the steak from the oven and place on a serving platter or cutting board. Do not, by any means cut it; instead rest it<a name=\"_GoBack\"></a> for 5-10 minutes.

Thankfully, I appear to have skipped the angry phase (though my husband might disagree) and am acutely aware that whilst feeling blue is a normal part of the settling in process, it is also the colour of Winter. As this season ‘coincidentally’ approaches towards the end of the year (it is not taken for granted if you spent time in the southern hemisphere), I realise that I may not [i]be[/i] sad, but [i]have ‘[/i]S.A.D.’ - Seasonal Affective Disorder. I am not making this up to justify a long and well-deserved holiday in the tropics. Google-doctor always knows best and my self-diagnosis was via the very reputable Mayo Clinic. The clinic says that ‘SAD’ begins and ends at about the same times every year, symptoms start in the fall (autumn) and continue into the winter months sapping energy and making one feel moody. Bingo! Aside from phototherapy (hello, tropics), the Mayo Clinic recommends treating ‘SAD’ via psychotherapy and medications. (I think I might have to change search engines and double-check this diagnosis).[/p][p]That doesn’t mean there is no such thing as the Shanghai Blues! They appear to be quite real and I don’t mean an evening perched at the Cotton Club plotting your next speakeasy. The blues here apparently escalate in Winter with levels of pollution. I was told this by veteran ‘Shanghailanders’ (as they claim to be) and after further deep and meaningful research (people talk [i]a lot[/i] after a few drinks) it was affirmed that the top three complaints of living here are (surprise surprise), pollution, food, and water safety. Essentially the very things key to survival – air, water and food.[/p][p]Checking the Air Quality Index every morning has recently become a tradition in our family (if you can call anything conducted in our three month stay thus far a ‘tradition’). We are highly competitive against Beijing with whom there appears to be an inverse relationship. When Shanghai is ‘green’ for a clear day, high fives resound as Beijing is ‘red’.  Beijing in our experience has never been green, but when its yellow and Shanghai is red, sad faces abound as we know what this means - no outdoor play, air filters on at high blast and wearing masks. Does this, coupled with watching where your produce comes from, having to buy drinking water in barrels and dodging traffic like a gaming character on speed justify the blues?[/p][p]To put it into perspective (given my ‘real’ research), 783 million people in the world don’t have access to clean water. Some even live in France as a 2009 study revealed that some sources don’t meet the World Health Organisations (‘WHO’) standards. This makes me feel better about not being able to drink from my tap [i]oui[/i]? Regarding pollution, 93% of Europe’s cities fail the WHO indexes and only 33% of American cities pass. I’m not sure now ‘who’ should be having the blues! On food, 842 million people suffer from undernourishment and Asia has 295 million. I am grateful to be able to wash my beans in filtered water.[/p][p]Sure, I get that its not the ‘ideal’ compared to what most of us are used to, but ‘most’ is in fact a very small number of the privileged looking at global statistics. At the end of the day, as someone reminded me, living in Shanghai is a choice and if you don’t like it, then [i]‘make like an autumn tree and leaf’[/i] (leave). Ok, I admit that person was 10-years-old and had lived here for seven, but I got the point.

They are then placed along the seven Chakras (a Sanskrit term for the major energy centers) of the spine and other trigger points along the body that have a therapeutic benefit.</p>\n\n<p>Massages are not just a way to pamper yourself; they can have a real and effective impact on the body and the mind.&nbsp; Because of the depth that the stones can reach in the body&rsquo;s tissue, hot stone therapy can assist in pain relief and circulation, more than your average oil massage.</p>\n\n<p>This time of year can lead to serious stress and depression for a multitude of reasons, and sometimes you just need to focus on yourself and your needs.&nbsp; If you&rsquo;re struggling with some intense tension and stress, treat yourself and a hot stone massage may just be the way to go. There are quite a few spas in Shanghai that offer massages with hot stones, but here are a couple that we tried for ourselves&hellip;</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>CHI, The Spa</strong></p>\n\n<p>Walking into CHI, the Spa at Jing An Shangri-La Hotel, we were immediately welcomed by staff and comfy long sofas. Before our massage we were given a nice warm cup of tea and sat in the tranquil interior of the lobby.&nbsp; The d&eacute;cor of the spa was quite simple, with Chinese accents, but a very warm design.</p>\n\n<p>We were then welcomed to our spacious room complete with shower, sink, and even a vanity where we could freshen up post massage. &nbsp;The room&rsquo;s pleasant coloring and serenity put us right in the mood to get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The massage began as an oil massage for the first 15 minutes, then masseuse stepped away for a moment and gathered the hot stones. The sounds of hot stones in the metal container and water were not particularly soothing, but it certainly got us anxious for the upcoming part of the treatment. At first, the temperature of the rocks was a bit of a surprise, but your body quickly gets used to it as the therapist continually moved the stones around.</p>\n\n<p>After flipping over, stones are placed along a vertical line of your torso, one rock under each shoulder, one under the neck and one in each hand, while the masseuse continues the oil massage on the lower body. We walked away feeling very relaxed and even more limber with our muscles being incredible warm and well massaged.</p>\n\n<p>A 120 minute hot stone massage here will set you back RMB1,580. It may not be cheap, but it is certainly luxurious and worth every kuai.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&gt;Jing An Shangri-La Hotel, 4/F, 1218 Yan&rsquo;an Zhong Lu, by Tongren Lu, (2203 8888, www.shangri-la.com)</p>\n</div>\n\n<h3><span style=\"font-size:13px; line-height:1.6em\">warm cup of tea and sat in the tranquil interior of the lobby.&nbsp; The d&eacute;cor of the spa was quite simple, with Chinese accents, but a very warm design.</span></h3>\n\n<div>\n<p>We were then welcomed to our spacious room complete with shower, sink, and even a vanity where we could freshen up post massage. &nbsp;The room&rsquo;s pleasant coloring and serenity put us right in the mood to get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The massage began as an oil massage for the first 15 minutes, then masseuse stepped away for a moment and gathered the hot stones.

This figure is expected to rise by three million annually in the coming years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are three kinds of single moms in China: unmarried women, divorced women and widowed women. No matter which category a female falls into, they face more or less the same difficulties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most serious problems faced by all single moms is the high cost of living, and of all regular expenses, the cost of their children&rsquo;s schooling makes up the largest chunk. In 2013, figures from the Guangzhou Women&rsquo;s Federation revealed that there were 6,190 single moms in Guangzhou registered as living in poverty, of whom 68 percent were reported to be additionally burdened due to the high cost of tuition fees, which is normally RMB1,500 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little or no support from ex-husbands, the inability to work due to being a stay-at-home mother and a lack of sufficient education have made it even harder for single moms to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Cuijuan divorced her husband in 2006 and took custody of their son, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of 6. In order to shoulder her monthly rent of RMB900 and the RMB1,600 for the specialist school her son attends, Lin has to work three jobs, toiling away from 4am to 10pm every day. &ldquo;I feel really tired, since my son fully relies on me. But seeing him receiving a proper education, I feel happy and satisfied,&rdquo; says Lin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another prominent issue affecting single moms involves the difficult of embarking on fresh relationships and finding a new spouse. A traditional Chinese saying goes: &ldquo;A good woman never marries a second husband (好女不嫁二夫),&rdquo; and the stigma attached to remarrying is still very prevalent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the PRC, many people brand divorced women as second-hand goods whose value has been lost; unmarried women with kids as corrupted; and widowed women as bad luck. A recent five-year survey following 100 divorced couples in Beijing revealed over a half of the interviewed males had re-married while just 15 percent of the females had found a husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from financial and societal pressures, single moms also worry about what their children will think if they remarry. An online survey conducted by Sina.com showed that about 60 percent of the women asked would only accept a proposal from a man if their kids were okay with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My daughter is important to me,&rdquo; says Ms. Fang, a 45-year-old single mom and a head nurse working in Guangzhou. &ldquo;If she says no, I will definitely not marry again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With China&rsquo;s increasing divorce rate and growing numbers of monetarily unstable single mothers, more attention has been focused on this previously overlooked group. In Guangzhou, for instance, the Guangzhou Women&rsquo;s Federation set up the Single Moms Rose Project in 2012 to empower women to learn new skills and achieve economic independence, as well as helping them to find their Mr. Right at matchmaking events. A sub-branch of this organization, the Liwan Women&rsquo;s Federation, arranges job-training classes for poor single mothers living in Liwan district.</p>'), ('1', '1', '374', '2', '<p>The time for face-kinis is just around the corner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some women in QIngdao, Shandong province enjoying their time in the sun&nbsp;wearing &#39;face bikinis&#39; to protect themselves from UV rays.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Face bikinis are a common sight in China, where people at the beach are far more likely to be desperately trying to avoid the sun, rather than trying for a tan.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&quot;I&#39;m afraid of getting dark,&quot; one woman told the<a href=\"http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/globalpost-blogs/weird-wide-web/face-kinis-china-beaches-summer\"> New York Times in 2012</a>. &quot;A woman should always have fair skin.

They have a grim one in 10 chance of finding happiness, will probably face divorce and will have very little luck in business.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Characteristics of those born in the year of the sheep are generous, shy, weak-willed, polite, and kind-hearted.

A phoenix man is one who rose from the ashes, grew up in a poor family, put himself through school and was expected to change the fate of his family.

During this time China prevented an estimated 400 million births. This notorious policy was applauded worldwide for slowing down China&#39;s rapid population growth, but also heavily criticized for enforcing abortions and forcing families to pay heavy fines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The birth control relaxation was first implemented in Zhejiang province on January 17, 2013. By the end of April, most of the provincial-level regions of China&#39;s mainland had officially launched the new policy. Most of the remaining provinces and autonomous regions plan to implement the policy later this year, according to China News Service.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Couples are allowed to have two children if one of the parents was an only child. Currently in Beijing, Chongqing, Tianjin, and Sichuan provinces, a couple is required to wait for three to four years before having their second baby. The only way this can be avoided is if the mother is above a certain age - usually 28 years old. An important age for women&rsquo;s fertility.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At most 60 percent of eligible couples born in the 1980s will choose to raise a second child, in turn this policy could lead to one million to two million more births in China every year, on top of the approximately 15 million births a year now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Families in China are now faced with a new dilemma - whether or not they can afford to have a bigger family.

Like many young women her age in China, Wang invests a significant amount of time and money in cosmetics. It&rsquo;s a trend that has helped propel the country&rsquo;s beauty industry to record profits. Last year, Chinese consumers spent USD25.9 billion on beauty products, making it the country&rsquo;s fourth largest sector for discretionary expenditure. Only houses, cars and travel rank higher.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;In China, your face really is your card to the world,&rdquo; says Joanna Hutchins, former Unilever Global Brand Director for Skin Care at Pond&rsquo;s and current Managing Director of Dragon Rouge, a global brand consultancy that counts almost 30 beauty brands among its global clientele. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s the case for both men and women.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The way you look, the quality of your skin, whether you appear tired or stressed &ndash; those have all become concerns of paramount importance to the Chinese middle class.&rdquo; This concept of mianzi (face), a social construct that runs deep within Chinese culture and relies on a person&rsquo;s surface appearances to reflect his or her status, is an important industry driver. White-collar women alone spend an average of 30 percent of their total income on cosmetic treatments and products.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Men are not far behind. According to research firm Euromonitor, the grooming sector &ndash; the second largest worldwide after South Korea &ndash; has seen an annual growth of 29 percent between 2009 and 2014, compared to 5.7 percent in North America and 7.9 percent in Europe. In a recent survey by consumer research firm Kantar Worldpanel, a whopping 73 percent of Chinese men in China&rsquo;s leading cities believe that looking good is essential for success with both women and work.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Chinese GDP continues to grow, so does the local appetite for skin care products, fragrances and men&rsquo;s cosmetics. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t see anything like that anywhere else in the world,&rdquo; says Hutchins. &ldquo;Consumers perceive beauty purchases as investments in their career, private life and social success. They consider appearances a major asset to their persona. Women want to transform, while men are not as interested in looking different as they are in looking perfect.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Interestingly, such obsession for a flawless and healthy image often only extends from the neck up. Chinese shoppers aren&rsquo;t as interested in body products &ndash; preserving one&rsquo;s pale skin by layering on clothes, even in summertime, is still common.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Facial skin care forms the most popular sector among the local market. Whitening products are the nation&rsquo;s highest sellers, followed closely by new-fangled, China-centric hydration products &ndash; which now represent almost one-third of all facial moisturizer sales in China. It is, quite literally, all about face.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A trip to Sephora on Shanghai&rsquo;s Nanjing Xi Lu &ndash; the French company&rsquo;s largest store worldwide &ndash; on a sunny Sunday afternoon helps confirm this theory. The place is packed with young, style-savvy women toting baskets filled with moisturizers, makeup removers, serums, blemish balm (BB) cream and face masks. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Protecting my skin from the sun is quite important to me,&rdquo; says 25-year-old Li Haitong, as she browses the store&rsquo;s selection of pricey, colorfully-packaged balms. &ldquo;I like to keep it hydrated and natural-looking. Hanskin BB Cream is great for that, but I also use a lot of Laneige products.&rdquo;&nbsp;Cost, she says, is not an issue. &ldquo;As long as I can be assured of the quality of the brand, then I&rsquo;m happy to spend the money.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both Laneige and BB Cream are Korean companies. In China, they are household names &ndash; no doubt due to their connection to South Korea&rsquo;s hugely successful pop culture wave, the so-called hallyu, which drives Seoul&#39;s growing influence across Asia.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Riding on the Korean soap opera and K-pop crazes, these beauty brands from the Land of the Morning Calm and further afield, have adopted perfectly-groomed Korean celebrity ambassadors such as actress Song Hye-kyo, singer Yoona and male entertainer Kim Hyun-joong to advertise products in China. In the process, they have also taken market share away from established western players.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Korean cosmetic companies are shaping an aspirational idea of beauty through clever, celeb-centered advertising that really resonates with the local market,&rdquo; says Hutchins. &ldquo;If you had walked into any department store just a few years ago, you would have seen lower-end brands like Olay, Lanc&ocirc;me, Nivea or Pond&rsquo;s filling up the shelves. Now, they are all being pushed out to make space for high-end Korean products. The whole retail scene is changing.&rdquo;<br />\r\nAt the end of December, US beauty firm Revlon announced it would pull out of China. One week later, French giant L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al, the world&rsquo;s largest cosmetics company and China market leader, joined its rival by halting sales of its Garnier beauty and hair products in the PRC. According to Euromonitor, both Procter &amp; Gamble and Avon have also lost market share in the skin care business in the six years leading up to 2012. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Most importantly, as product ranges expand, shoppers are no longer interested in paying premium prices for brands that are not necessarily the very best in terms of quality. And while many western companies have missed this shift, Korean firms have been quick to keep up. &ldquo;I prefer Korean brands,&rdquo; says recent graduate Wang Yan. &ldquo;They are ahead of the trends and use better technology. Whereas western brands are developed for western faces, Korean products are developed especially for Asian skin tones.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Showing sensitivity to Asian beauty habits and an understanding of Mainland consumers&rsquo; concerns, Chinese companies like Herborist and Inoherb have also found increasing popularity within the sector &ndash; the two firms are the first and second largest domestic brands in the skin care sector &ndash; often opting for a more expansive approach to beauty that integrates TCM principles or natural therapies. According to market research company Mintel, this addresses the wishes of 37 percent of the market. It&rsquo;s no surprise that home players are doing so well.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to the cultural and historical ties binding Chinese consumers to TCM-based remedies, natural alternatives are seen as less toxic than their chemically-inclined cousins, a selling point for savvy consumers who have grown up confronted by a barrage of product safety scandals.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s been a tremendous change over the last three years,&rdquo; notes Hutchins. &ldquo;In Asia, for the first time, Europe and America have had very little influence on beauty. It used to be all about the West influencing the East&hellip; now the East is looking up to itself and its own culture, as there&rsquo;s a fundamental belief that Asian skin is different from western skin. Next, the continent will be telling the rest of the world about beauty trends.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>China&rsquo;s beauty market is also molding its very own traits and identity via online retailers. E-platforms account for 20 percent of all sales in the country, often offering a wide range of brands at big discounts &ndash; which, again, takes a toll on foreign rivals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to Mintel analyst Chen Wenwen, the key to long-lasting success lies in the right balance of online and offline branding.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The beauty retailing market continues to perform strongly, but in order to increase expansion, integrating both online and offline channels becomes a must,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;Affluent consumers are still longing for memorable in-store shopping experiences, and that remains essential in the long-run.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Meanwhile, there are even some Asian products that have been making headway in the western beauty world. Having debuted in both the US and Europe in 2011, BB creams have seen growth rates of around 30 percent in the West according to Euromonitor, becoming cult beauty products in the global market.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Face masks &ndash; products still relatively niche abroad but tremendously popular in China &ndash; have also&nbsp;entered the radar of beauty purveyors worldwide. Shortly after announcing its exit from China, L&rsquo;Or&eacute;al went on to acquire Magic Holdings International, a Hong Kong-listed cosmetics producer and China&rsquo;s largest facial mask company, for USD840 million, saying in its press release: &ldquo;facial masks are one of China&rsquo;s beauty market&rsquo;s fastest-growing areas, with very promising development prospects.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>At the same time, recent news that the China Food and Drug Administration will loosen its regulations surrounding animal testing for cosmetics from June 2014 is likely to stir new interest among a number of beauty brands previously blocked from the Chinese market entirely, pushing the sector to increasingly competitive levels.&nbsp;<br />\r\n&ldquo;Every major player in the industry is looking to win a bigger slice of China&rsquo;s beauty market pie,&rdquo; says Hutchins. &ldquo;The country may not be the most trend-setting in terms of products yet, but it&rsquo;s definitely leading when it comes to customer needs and development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The Chinese want better products and that&rsquo;s driving new retail strategies and marketing messages from all companies involved &ndash; both western and Asian.

Next to them, a stall selling oyster omelettes and guangbao - steamed bun sandwiches filled with hearty chunks of braised pork belly, pickled Chinese cabbage and powdered peanuts &ndash; entice with an alluring whiff of meat, seafood, and griddle-cooked vegetables, making it impossible not to succumb to temptation. And why shouldn&rsquo;t we? We are in Shilin Market, one of the island&rsquo;s most famous night markets, and food &ndash; mouth-watering, colorful, decadent food &ndash; is everywhere.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This, we&rsquo;re soon to find out, is a recurring feature of Taipei.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard to walk more than a few paces down the street without being lured by peddlers carrying delectable snacks, unremarkable eateries offering bowlfuls of chewy noodles and restaurants promising &ndash; and delivering &ndash; tales of palatable eats we will recount long after our visit.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bewildering in their range of dishes, night markets should be on anyone&rsquo;s must-do list when traveling to the city. Wandering is a pastime that suits Taipei well, and these culinary hubs are perfect places to do just that, with their maze-like alleyways, vibrant stalls and makeshift tables, each selling different xiao chi (small eats).</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An inclination for adventure is essential; the island&rsquo;s food is a mash-up of aboriginal, Hakka and Min cuisine with a bias towards the refined cooking of Shanghai and eastern China, meaning flavors are bold, diverse and often unexpected. Snacks like stinky tofu, pigs&rsquo; blood rice pudding, and ribs steamed in medicinal herbs are regular features of any street market &ndash; unappetizing as they may sound, they actually make for some excellent stomach-fillers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides the metropolis&rsquo; main landmarks &ndash; Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall, Longshan Temple and Taipei 101 &ndash; it&rsquo;s easy to make market-hopping the main purpose of a trip. Raohe, one of the oldest night markets in Taipei and our next destination after Shilin, has one of the best food selections around. Here we indulge on salt-crusted kebabs and pressed-to-order sugarcane nectar, finishing off our tour with two remarkably large portions of &ldquo;mango avalanche&rdquo; and &ldquo;strawberry blizzard&rdquo; &ndash; piles of shaved ice heaped with juicy fruit, flavorings and condensed milk that take the edge off the tropical heat. Huaxi is a more bizarre experience, with food items like snake &ndash; served plain or in soup &ndash; on offer alongside a good number of sex toys and dubious DVDs.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For a better insight into Taiwan&rsquo;s local culinary style, a visit to Ningxia night market is also mandatory. Moseying lazily from one stall to the next, we munch on moreish pan-fried pork buns and a delightfully oily egg-and-flour-based pancake showered with shallots, glossy strips of seasoned bok choy and fried pork slithers, handed to us fresh from the griddle. Washing it all down with some good old bubble tea &ndash; Taiwan&rsquo;s ubiquitous drink &ndash; it&rsquo;s not long before our quest for yet more delicacies resumes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Signs for niu rou mian &ndash; the island&rsquo;s ultimate comfort food &ndash; are easy to spot, even for the Mandarin-illiterate. A bowl of it can be obtained at virtually any restaurant around town. Try the first international chain to introduce upmarket Taiwanese folk cooking, Shin Yeh. It does delicious<br />\r\nrenditions of this staple dish without the rough edges of the night markets; the final result being a balanced affair of thick noodles nestled in a dark, spicy broth and topped with heaps of beef shanks, assorted vegetables and pickled greens.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Similarly, ba-wan and their delicious fillings of pork and veggies can be found at most food courts, where you&rsquo;re allowed to pile up as much food on your tray as you like, with each dish incurring a fairly small charge. The court under Taipei 101 is the biggest and busiest; take a seat on one of the fixed metal tables and soak in the boisterous atmosphere as a motley assortment of Taipei&rsquo;s locals stop in for a tea, a chat and a snack.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Ay-chung Mee Suah, not far from Huaxi night market, is a perfect stop to taste oya misua. The small restaurant only serves this dish in two sizes: small and large. Vermicelli floats in a thickened soup with oysters and pig intestines, topped with a dash of cilantro and finished off with a swig of black vinegar and some minced garlic. Perfection.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Taiwanese cuisine is also heavily influenced by Japanese and fusion cooking. Japan occupied Taiwan for 50 years during the first half of the 20th century and its legacy left a mark on the nation&rsquo;s taste buds. Our last meal in the city is at the Addiction Aquatic Development, Taipei&rsquo;s former fish market and now a chic warehouse space with a standing sushi bar and Japanese grill. The menu is overwhelming, the quality of the seafood on par with Tokyo or Kyoto.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sated yet foraging for one last bite after our dinner of raw fish and sak&eacute;, a walk down a nearby night market unveils more dumplings, sweet treats and soupy concoctions. Resistance is pointless. If there&rsquo;s one thing we&rsquo;ve learned from this trip, that would be it.

These are power foods that can help to achieve weight loss or simply help with an overall healthy diet.</span><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">&nbsp;</span><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Red Beans</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>These beans are loaded with fiber and help you fight inflammation, cancer, and harmful bacteria; in addition, it&#39;s been shown to help lower insulin levels. The hefty fiber content of beans also helps you feel fuller, and store less fat, lowers cholesterol and triglycerides, and improves insulin sensitivity.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The B vitamins and zinc in beans boost testosterone, which is a good thing! Testosterone helps to increase our energy and build more calorie-burning muscle.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dried beans are better for you than canned beans, plus you avoid concerns about possible BPA in the lining of the cans. Soak them for six to eight hours in room temperature water, then drain before cooking.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Look for no-salt varieties.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rinse thoroughly before cooking &mdash; especially if you end up using canned.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Garlic</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Found in most Chinese cuisine is so easy to incorporate in your diet. This goes for other foods in the allium family (onions, leeks, chives, shallots, and scallions). These foods work to stimulate the production of glutathione, an antioxidant that is especially important in the liver, where it helps remove hormone-disrupting chemicals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Alliums also lower total cholesterol while raising the level of HDL cholesterol (the &quot;good&quot; kind). Preliminary research suggests that garlic may boost testosterone, giving you more energy, while onions have anthocyanins, effective free-radical destroyers that might also help combat obesity and diabetes. Crushing, chopping, or chewing garlic helps release enzymes that trigger many of its beneficial actions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Berries</strong><br />\r\nRed berries contain anthocyanins, which some studies have found stop individual fat cells from getting larger, while also encouraging them to release adiponectin, a hormone that helps reduce inflammation, lower blood sugar, and reverse leptin and insulin resistance. Certain polyphenols found in raspberries and strawberries block the digestive enzyme activity of specific starches and fats, reducing your body&#39;s absorption of them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>All these great metabolism-boosting qualities make these berries serious power foods. Add strawberries to a yogurt or cup of cottage cheese for breakfast, cut some up for a dessert, or mix them into a smoothie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Broccoli</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, and cabbage pack serious nutritional power in just a few calories per bite. They have high water and fiber content; this combination helps you feel full AND increases your body&#39;s ability to burn fat by as much as 30 percent. Plus, studies have consistently shown that people who eat the most fiber gain the LEAST amount of weight and these veggies are a great fiber source.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Just remember: don&rsquo;t overcook cruciferous veggies, they will lose their nutritional power &mdash; and flavor!.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Whole Grains</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whole grains like oats and barley have great nutritional value and can even help control your appetite. The short-chain fatty acids from whole grains help us eat less because they stimulate fat cells in our stomachs to release leptin, the satiety (or the &quot;I&#39;m full&quot;) hormone . The high levels of fiber in whole grains also help us feel full by slowing blood-sugar release and steadying insulin levels. The trick is to eat grains that are truly whole &mdash; no refined carbs like white bread.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Green Tea</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When caffeine is abused, it damages your metabolism and hormone balance. On the other hand, caffeine, when used correctly, can be an excellent energy and metabolism boost. When you overdose on it, it taxes your adrenal glands, stressing you out, leaving you tired and run down. The key with caffeine is to not consume more than 400 mg in a day. That&#39;s the equivalent to two strong cups of coffee. The healthier choice? Green tea. You will still get a caffeine boost, but green tea has been shown to promote fat oxidation at rest and is believed to prevent obesity and improve insulin sensitivity. Limit yourself to one or two caffeinated beverages a day, and drink one extra glass of water for each caffeinated beverage you consume.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[photo via <a href=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/michaelalexander2008/2234618733/in/photolist-4pt1ic-jyQDBq-5GQEtP-i3MXxR-5JdZ5S-wVf7v-iBUJj-5n7kjV-gMz2V-5oY16m-6hWioQ-8rTbSa-ezP4SM-5UvExi-hSSdqC-811ttV-5uqr46-cxqhbu-39zCa-5qam1d-hxboEw-7NMXQD-hyLB7w-5q6ouT-6kJBjL-32eQxm-79FTVU-hTdczF-8YF5PW-8bBHcK-ciDorC-feqXfc-hJVXtf-7HbJ4A-jEH2Ua-8v9K79-cphc2w-crNm2J-48ep8C-aJ5hz8-fM7dC1-dyKZRo-kLZXun-hqv9Te-9coLL1-dP95c8-4yS4m-hTLyDD-9TR2e9-eYDdR8\">Flickr]</a></p>'), ('1', '1', '406', '3', '<p>Brought to you by <a href=\"http://mothersniche.com/101-finger-foods-babies-toddlers/#_a5y_p=1595400\">Mother&#39;s Niche</a>, here are a list of baby-friendly foods you can wrap up and snack up for your little kiddos on the go!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>peas</p>\r\n\r\n<p>corn</p>\r\n\r\n<p>cooked asparagus tips</p>\r\n\r\n<p>cut up green beans</p>\r\n\r\n<p>steamed broccoli (cut up)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>steamed cauliflower (cut up)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>steamed carrots (cut up)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cucumbers (cubed)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Avocado (cut up)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Potato (baked &amp; cubed)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Crispy Fruit &amp; Veggie Chews</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sweet Potato (Roasted and Cubed)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Squash (cut up and roasted or baked)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Zucchini (steamed and cut up)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Grape Tomato (cut in halves or fourths)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Earth&rsquo;s Best Happy Snax</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cut up strawberries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Blueberries</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raspberries (cut as needed)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sliced Bananas</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cut up Crepes with fruit, peanut butter and applesauce</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kiwi (cut up)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fiddlesticks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Mango (cubed or sliced)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cut up Fruit Popsicles</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Applesauce (for dipping things in)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Almond Butter (for spreading on cut up toast or veggies)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Organic Fruit Snacks</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Raisins (if they are soft)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chicken and Noodles (If you&rsquo;re having Chicken Noodle soup for dinner, cut it up for baby)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Freeze Dried Fruit and Veggies</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sliced Apples &amp; Peanut Butter</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cut up String cheese</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cottage Cheese</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Yogurt Bites (freeze bite size yogurt dots)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little Yums</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Olives (diced)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rinsed Black Beans</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rinsed Kidney Beans</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rinsed Pinto Beans (as well as other beans.

Glucose is an energy source for the body. Insulin, a hormone produced in the pancreas, helps move glucose from the blood stream to the body&rsquo;s cells. In diabetes, insulin is either not produced by the body (Type 1 diabetes) or works ineffectively (Type 2 diabetes). Type 2 diabetes is more common and associated with increased weight and inactivity. Both types of diabetes result in high blood glucose levels.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What complications can result from diabetes?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Diabetes can result in many serious medical problems. Prolonged levels of high blood glucose can damage multiple organ systems including the eyes (leading to blindness), kidneys (leading to kidney failure and dialysis) and the nervous system (leading to decrease in sensation, injuries to extremities, and amputations). Diabetes also damages the cardiovascular system and dramatically increases the risk for heart attacks and stroke, particularly in those that smoke.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Why is diabetes an epidemic?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The World Health Organization noted in 2013 that 350 million people worldwide had diabetes. In particular, China has been called the &ldquo;World&rsquo;s New Diabetes Capital.&rdquo; Recent studies have shown that China has the most number of patients with diabetes in the world and that rate of diabetes in China is even higher than in the United States. Rates of diabetes are especially high in urban areas like Shanghai. &nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the symptoms of diabetes and how is it diagnosed?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>While diabetes can sometimes be asymptomatic, people with diabetes may experience frequent urination, thirst, hunger, fatigue and blurry vision. Diabetes can be diagnosed by common blood tests including a blood glucose level (often done after fasting) or hemoglobin A1C test. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include having close family members with diabetes, inactivity, being overweight, having early diabetes (also known as prediabetes), and having had diabetes during pregnancy.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If I have diabetes, what should I do?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Controlling blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol (typically with the help of medications), as well as regular eye and foot checks and lab testing, are key components to managing diabetes. Quitting smoking, increasing physical activity, eating a healthy diet and finding a good physician and team that will work with you to manage all of these issues is extremely important. Shanghai United Family Hospital has developed a special program and package to help patients with diabetes receive optimal care. By being diligent about maintaining their health, patients with diabetes can best minimize the risk for complications associated with this epidemic condition.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Image via <a href=\"http://www.chicagonow.com/living-with-diabetes/2012/06/autoimmune-or-not-whats-type-1b-diabetes/\">Chicago Now</a>]</p>'), ('1', '1', '410', '1', '<p>By Trevor Marshallsea</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s started already. My offspring are only 8 and 7, yet I&rsquo;m undergoing a common parental transformation. I&rsquo;m changing not so much from hero to zero &ndash; as the clich&eacute; goes &ndash; but from hero to complete, utter, hideous embarrassment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This happens to expat parents earlier than to common house parents. It&rsquo;s not because expat kids are more precocious than domesticated ones (though they do get world-weary by the age of about five). It&rsquo;s because of the language they use. In our case, the language is Chinese.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Parents often complain they can&rsquo;t understand what their kids are saying. In this case, it&rsquo;s the reverse. I could swear, bellow or shriek &ndash; all are more acceptable to my daughters than me speaking Chinese.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>My particular brand of Mandarin gets described in various ways by various people. These include &ldquo;Great!&rdquo; by me; &ldquo;Fantastic, amazing, I can&rsquo;t believe you&rsquo;re not Chinese,&rdquo; by the polite locals; &ldquo;Awesome!&rdquo; (me again); &ldquo;No, we&rsquo;re laughing at you,&rdquo; by my wife; &ldquo;Lucrative,&rdquo; by my Chinese teacher; and &ldquo;Dad, are you speaking Chinese?&rdquo; by my two insubordinates.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s easy for them to say. It&rsquo;s a lot harder for me to say.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">This is because they&rsquo;ve been learning it, properly, from the ages of three and one. They don&rsquo;t know it&rsquo;s sometimes ranked third-hardest language on Earth (I&rsquo;m never going to the Basque country or Hungary). And they didn&rsquo;t have to get their head around any linguistic revolutions, because everything was new to them anyway.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike them, with my greater years I could assess things about Mandarin &ndash; such as how learning to use its four tones correctly is actually very hard. That&rsquo;s why I took an important early decision concerning the tones: that I would not bother using them.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">I do get by with my Chinese. I can make myself understood, though sometimes it&rsquo;s like a dodgy lawnmower &ndash; it can take a few goes, and some physicality, to get it operational &ndash; and is about as pleasing on the ear. And quite often, bits fall off and I can&rsquo;t find them again when I need them. Such as little words that mean so much, like zi.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&lsquo;D&agrave; xiāngzi&rsquo; means &lsquo;big box.&rsquo; Forget the &lsquo;zi,&rsquo; however, and &ndash; assuming you&rsquo;ve got the wrong tone &ndash; you&rsquo;ll be talking about quite a different object. This was illustrated by a recent exchange between myself and a bookstore assistant, witnessed by my two cringing girls:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: I&rsquo;ve bought quite a few books. Do you have a bag?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Shop Assistant: No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: Then do you have an elephant?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SA: What?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: An elephant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SA: Err, no.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: Do you have an elephant out the back?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SA: No.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: Really?!&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SA: Really, we don&rsquo;t.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: Jeez! What kind of a...</p>\r\n\r\n<p>SA: Ooooh! You mean a big box!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: Yes! That&rsquo;s what I said &ndash; an elephant!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Not only did they not keep a d&agrave; xi&agrave;ng out back, they didn&rsquo;t have a big box or bag. So who looks foolish now, hmmm? I blamed the kids, for not correcting me sooner. They defended themselves, saying they had &ldquo;no idea what the hell&rdquo; I was talking about.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The girls were excited about our recent trip to Harbin for the Festival of Freezing Your Butt Off. Well they were excited, until I started asking our hotel&rsquo;s young female receptionist about dog sledding.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I figured &lsquo;chē&rsquo; would do for &lsquo;sled,&rsquo; as it&rsquo;s used for most vehicles, although it does sound a lot like &lsquo;eat&rsquo; (chī). And, heck, it&rsquo;s easy to confuse &lsquo;dog&rsquo; (gǒu) and &lsquo;tall&rsquo; (gāo), right? Any fool could do it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: We want the vehicles that go on the ice!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Receptionist: A sled?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: Yes. The kind that are pulled by the tall.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Receptionist: The&hellip; the what?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me: You know? We want to eat&hellip; a tall sled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Receptionist: (The Chinese for WTF?!)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me (with dogsled-driving actions): This!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lani: Daddy! She thinks you&rsquo;re doing Gangnam Style.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Me (still doing Gangnam Style): Woof! Woof!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kids edged away. The receptionist stared. Who knew Chinese dogs don&rsquo;t say &lsquo;woof woof?&rsquo; Turns out they say &lsquo;wang wang.&rsquo; (German dogs say &lsquo;vow vow&rsquo;; Albanians &lsquo;ham ham,&rsquo; etc.) The receptionist clearly had no idea who or what goes &lsquo;woof woof&rsquo; while doing Gangnam Style in a hotel lobby, but you could tell it wasn&rsquo;t something she&rsquo;d easily forget.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>OK, I admit my Chinese can be like a can of worms left open in a minefield. For example, our ayi&rsquo;s two favorite sayings of mine are:</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The kids are hungry! Give them a scooter!&rdquo; (Snack: xiǎochī; small vehicle: xiǎochē.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Their hands are cold! Get them some chips!&rdquo; (Gloves: shǒut&agrave;o; French fries: shǔti&aacute;o.)</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But I&rsquo;m heaps better than the kids in other areas. I mastered swearing, slang and Beijing&rsquo;s &lsquo;pirate&rsquo; accent early on. There&rsquo;s no way the girls could say: &ldquo;That&rsquo;s not the #*%@ing price we agreed, you son of a turtle!&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sometimes I feel I bumble through life here like Mr. Magoo.

Offering an interesting insight the life of Uighurs, the article has since received wide attention from China&rsquo;s mostly Han readers on social media. The Chinese President Xi Jinping has referred to it at a meeting and has asked the Communist Party members located in Xinjiang to study the issues raised in his article.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Kurbanjan is is a native of Hotan, a predominantly Uighur&nbsp;town in the south of China&rsquo;s Xinjiang region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Read his story here:</p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">***</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hotan is a very traditional Uighur area in Xinjiang, but our family is a bit different from others. Of the four children in my generation, three do not live in Xinjiang. One of my younger brothers runs the family jade shop in Shenzhen, a metropolis in southern China, and the other also works in Shenzhen at a wedding photography company as a photo processor. My sister is the only one living in Hotan; she works as a Mandarin teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In southern Xinjiang, it would be nearly impossible to find another family like ours. I attribute that to my parents, especially my father. He loves talking to strangers, respects educated people, and is always learning something new. My father is originally from Artux near Kashgar [a city in Xinjiang], and his business philosophy and approach to life are quite different from other jade traders.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Around 1984, not long after economic reforms began in China, my father began a jade trading business and frequently traveled to inland China, and his worldview was significantly expanded. He often talked to us about his trips, the things he had seen, and the people he had met. He told us, &ldquo;You are boys, you have to go out and see the world.&rdquo; He often told our family and friends that &ldquo;I will get all three of my sons out of Hotan.&rdquo; Now, he has indeed achieved that goal. Our family and our religious views, as a result, are different from other Uighur families in Hotan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">When I was little, my siblings and I could not recite the Quran. During school breaks in the winter and summer, my mother wanted to send us to Quranic schools, but our father did not support it. They had many fights over this issue. My father thought that we were young and could choose for ourselves when we grew up and had our own understandings of the world. My mother was worried that if we didn&rsquo;t study the Quran, we would be kuffar, or infidels, in the eyes of other Uighurs and become outcasts in the local community. My father told her that he alone would shoulder all the responsibility. When I was little, I didn&rsquo;t know why my father thought that way, but gradually, especially in the past few years, as Hotan has become even more conservative and hostile in terms of religious beliefs, I have come to think of him as a great man.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In order to give us a better education, my parents moved several times in Hotan until they found a neighborhood that had studious children. In Hotan, it was really hard to learn Chinese (because about 96.4 percent of the population is Uighur). Until I went to middle school in 1998, I only knew a few Chinese characters, like &ldquo;me,&rdquo; &ldquo;you,&rdquo; &ldquo;him,&rdquo; and &ldquo;love.&rdquo; In 10th grade, I had a crush on a neighbor Uighur girl who was also learning Chinese, and I wrote &ldquo;I love you&rdquo; to her. That was my first time writing Chinese characters.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Because none of my siblings went to Quranic school, to this day my mother&rsquo;s brothers and sisters won&rsquo;t even talk to her. Even when they run into her occasionally, they say things like, &ldquo;We need a translator to talk to your children,&rdquo; implying that her children are quasi-Han, even though all of us can speak perfect Uighur. My siblings and I are also ostracized by our relatives. We have more than 30 cousins on my mother&rsquo;s side but none of them would play with us when we were little. They called us kuffar. This has caused my parents a great deal of anguish and pain.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, my parents are both devout Muslims. They pray five times a day, fast during Ramadan, and help those around them to the best of their abilities. As I was born into a Muslim family, faith is in my blood, but only after I grew up did I understand what my father wanted from us: Only after learning knowledge and seeing the world could we understand religion, and turn the religious passages that we had memorized into wisdom.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now my mother&rsquo;s greatest wish is to go on the hajj to Mecca. Because Saudi Arabia gives China a quota on the number of people allowed to go on the hajj, and Xinjiang, especially Hotan, has too many applicants, she put her name on the list four years ago. However, now the party cadre in our village told her that she may never be able to go. [Ed: Approximately 11,000 to 13,000 Muslims from China attend the hajj each year, depending on the quota determined by the Saudi authorities.]</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The hajj is the most important religious duty in a Muslim&rsquo;s life. My siblings and I want to do everything in our ability to fulfill my mother&rsquo;s wish. In fact, in 2013 a village cadre had told my mother that it was her turn. She was full of hope but heard nothing more. My mother only found out later, after other pilgrims had returned from Mecca, that her spot was given away because she did not pay a bribe.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">My parents did not want to bribe anyone in order to join the hajj because that would have been sacrilegious. But in Hotan, one cannot get anything done without bribery, and the need to pay for hajj spots was well known. I was irritated but still wanted to pay the bribe behind my mother&rsquo;s back. I found a local official but he made more excuses, saying my mother could not go because she was over 60 years old, and also because my sister worked as a teacher in a public school.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I did not understand how my married sister&rsquo;s having a teaching job could affect my mother&rsquo;s spot in the hajj quota, but upon hearing this, my sister even offered to resign her position. I called the official back; he still said no, because my sister&rsquo;s husband is also employed as a teacher.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">In southern Xinjiang, it is hard for Uighurs to find jobs. Many work as police assistants or teachers because other government or party organizations are nearly impossible to get into. I once went to a remote village in Hotan prefecture. There were nine people on the local party propaganda team, and the only Uighur among them was a driver. I asked them, &ldquo;You are all Han and do not speak the Uighur language, how can you do your job and reach out to the villagers?&rdquo; Their answer? &ldquo;It is what it is.&rdquo; These local party cadres are completely out of touch with the Uighur community. How can there not be any resentment?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regarding the issue of my mother going on the hajj, I think some of these Hotan local officials are wrong. What they are carrying out is not China&rsquo;s official ethnic policy nor Xinjiang autonomous region&rsquo;s stated policy. If it stays like this for the long term, there will be serious problems with the local community. It&rsquo;s a good thing that my siblings and I are educated and will not go overboard in our reactions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A few years ago, my youngest brother did not do well in high school and became our family&rsquo;s biggest headache. In 2007, he dropped out in ninth grade and started mixing with other young delinquents. My father asked me to get him out of Hotan. I asked my brother if he wanted to come to Beijing, but he absolutely refused to leave Hotan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fortunately by the end of 2007, a Han friend of mine from Sichuan opened a photography company in Hotan and I asked my brother to go help out. My brother became interested in photo processing and could sit doing that for eight or nine hours straight.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But after the ethnic riots in Urumqi in July 2009, there were some tiffs among the employees at my brother&rsquo;s workplace. At the photography company, everyone other than my brother was a Han. The most serious incident started with the tiniest spark. One Han man was listening to a song by Taiwanese rap star Jay Chou but my brother preferred the Hong Kong rock band Beyond, so he changed the music to Beyond. The Han man called my brother an ethnic slur and my brother threw a water glass at him. Such a small thing had escalated into ethnic conflict.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My friend, who owned the business, fired the Han and scolded my brother. The Han thought the treatment was unfair and wanted to smash up the place. The Han had gathered more than 20 fellow migrant workers hankering to beat up my brother, but my brother had called up about 40 or 50 Uighur friends to come over as well. This was quite a dangerous situation given the ethnic riots that had just happened in Urumqi. My friend did not know what was going on and gave me a call. I was extremely nervous and told him to call the police immediately. The police came and took everyone away, averting bloodshed.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">After that incident, I could not let my brother stay in Hotan lest something were to happen. I bought him a plane ticket to Shenzhen the next day and arranged a job for him at a photography shop there. After he arrived in Shenzhen, I told his new employer that I would bear full responsibility for his conduct and found friends at the local police station to vouch for him.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When he first went to Shenzhen, my brother had trouble fitting in. However, after only six months, he returned to Hotan for three days and already felt out of place. He told me himself that he had &rdquo;wasted almost 20 years in Hotan. Shenzhen is better and I will go back there.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now my brother works for a chain wedding photography company in Shenzhen and he is a popular guy. I spoke to his supervisors and they all liked him. He works hard and has a special touch with colors. In Hotan, we didn&rsquo;t have much green but a lot of warm yellow, like the color of a sandstorm. My brother is a master of the warm color palette.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My brother now gets along well with Han people around him. Out of more than a thousand employees in his company, he is the only ethnic minority and the only one from Xinjiang. Many of his co-workers had never had any contact with people from Xinjiang, but after working with him they now think well of people from there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By now my brother has developed a good reputation at the company and has earned people&rsquo;s appreciation through his hard work. I asked him, &ldquo;Do you still want to go back to Hotan?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;No, I really like Shenzhen and want to settle here.&rdquo; He thinks Shenzhen is a very tolerant place, and his talent can be appreciated there. Nowadays, my brother is a totally different person from his friends in Hotan, in everything from manner of dress to lifestyle. My father no longer worries about him.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Hotan, many Uighurs do not welcome Han in their homes. If they hosted Hans, the Uighurs would throw away the plates, chopsticks, and bowls that the Han used. But our family was different, and I didn&rsquo;t feel the ethnic divide as much growing up. We played with a lot of Han children when we were young. They also came to our home and ate the pilaf rice that my mother made. My best friend in Hotan is a Han who was born and raised there. He speaks fluent Uighur and often visits my parents on holidays. He told them, &ldquo;When Kurbanjan is not here, I&rsquo;m your eldest,&rdquo; and gave them a goat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As a Uighur living in inland China, there are inconveniences from time to time, but I&rsquo;ve gotten used to it. After the terrorist attack on Tiananmen Square in October 2013, I was driving toward Tiananmen Square when a police officer stopped me to check my car. I pulled over and politely obliged. I can understand this type of profiling; it was an unusual occasion.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Every time I have tried to check into a hotel in China, there would be all sorts of security checks or just flat-out rejections, and I can understand that as well. My Han colleagues who travel with me sometimes do not, and they ask the hotel staff, &ldquo;Why check him but not us?&rdquo; One time at the airport, my colleague almost got into a fight with the security guard because he had asked me to take off my shoes but not my colleague. I told my colleague that the security guard was only doing his job. Whenever I try to visit a foreign country, I also receive a very lengthy check.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My supervisors and colleagues at CCTV all like me a lot. I work hard and no one treats me differently because I&rsquo;m a Uighur. When I first began working, however, there were some inconveniences, but people around me all accommodated me. On business trips with more than a dozen people, they&rsquo;d search for a halal restaurant for me. I&rsquo;d tell them that I&rsquo;m fine with a Han restaurant but they would insist on finding a halal one just for me. If we ended up going to a Han restaurant, they&rsquo;d ask the waitress to get me tomato with fried eggs and rice (which are acceptable to Muslims). My colleagues and I are all used to it now.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I&rsquo;m not interested in politics. When I went to the United States and Turkey, some of my friends were quite worried about the contact I might have with foreigners. [Ed: Uighurs share much linguistic, cultural, and religious affinity with Turks. There is a large Uighur community in Turkey, where many have been able to obtain political asylum and Turkish citizenship.] But my father has taught me not to do anything that would destabilize society or come into contact with anyone with extremist tendencies. After I went to Beijing for work, I had many opportunities to travel abroad. My father said not to talk to strangers outside the country because they don&rsquo;t understand what&rsquo;s going on in China and Xinjiang especially. Even Chinese don&rsquo;t have a good understanding of Xinjiang; how could foreigners? Many foreigners have made up stories or hyped up small matters into big ones, and use those lies as a way to make a living for themselves. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t have any contact with them, just do your job,&rdquo; my father said.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s hard for me to get a passport in China. I can understand that as well. If other Uighurs like me had gone abroad with honest intentions to study or do business and returned to China with no incidents, there wouldn&rsquo;t be such issues, but some Uighurs have told many lies after they had gone abroad, and I have gotten angry at them for doing that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 2009, I traveled to the northeastern city of Shenyang and the hotel I booked refused to let me stay. The police came to resolve this issue. I told them that I&rsquo;m a hotel club member and made a reservation, and there is absolutely no reason not to let me stay the night. The police talked to me for more than two hours, finally letting me sleep at 3 a.m. The next day I went to an Internet caf&eacute;, and the guy at the caf&eacute; glanced at my ID card and, without even looking at me, told me that &ldquo;Your ethnicity is not allowed to access the Internet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Later I wrote an essay about these stories with the sarcastic title &ldquo;Xinjiangers are Welcome Everywhere in China,&rdquo; but found out two weeks later that the essay was posted on the Internet and had gone viral. I opened my email inbox to find more than 300 messages, a lot of them requests from foreign media to interview me. I was dumbfounded and a little scared. I called a close Han friend and mentor and told him that I wanted to argue with them and set the record straight, but he said that they could twist every one of my words into a hundred.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other messages told me I could go to Hong Kong, France, or Germany for interviews and they could somehow make me into a German citizen even if I didn&rsquo;t have a passport. I deleted all those messages and did not go on the Internet for two days. Six months later, a friend in the U.S. came back to China and told me that he had read the essay overseas, but the title was changed to &ldquo;Sorry, Your ethnicity is not allowed to access the Internet.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A lot of people from Xinjiang have an incomplete understanding of Turkey. Many who have visited Turkey don&rsquo;t present the whole truth when they return to Xinjiang, but rather only what is useful to them. Many have over-emphasized the Islamic elements in Turkey and put it on a pedestal. But they have not considered why Turkey is able to achieve its level of development. Turkey has relied heavily on secularization and the convergence of all types of cultures. Turkish culture is very tolerant. Because the country stands at the crossroads between Europe and Asia, it has taken on both cultures. Its Islam is quite secularized and absorbs what&rsquo;s good.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think Turkey is a good place for tourism and business, but I wouldn&rsquo;t be able to live there. Turkish people treat Uighurs as their brethren, but not real brothers. I think it&rsquo;s an unequal relationship with Turks on top, like telling us that &ldquo;I&rsquo;m your big brother, you can depend on me&rdquo; but they don&rsquo;t help us in any real way. I&rsquo;m not used to that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Nowadays, the understanding and interpretation of Islam of many people in Xinjiang are quite different from what is actually in the Quran &mdash; they have become narrower and more hostile. Many friends have told me that the photos I took on my recent trip to Urumqi and Hotan are over-Photoshopped and way too dark. I tell them, &ldquo;That is the color that I see and I feel. A normal black and white photo should have a transitional gray color that balances out the black and white, but now that balance is lost.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>That is what I want to say: Most people in Xinjiang have lost this balance and turned toward a darker side. Xinjiang now has large swaths of black and small specks of white, which is unbalanced and depressive.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The religious understanding of many people in Xinjiang has become problematic. We should be moving forward, but instead Xinjiang is now regressing. That is a scary thing. They say they want to &ldquo;return to the Quran&rdquo; but they do not really understand what that means. The government has not given them good guidance either. These factors have put the squeeze on the balance between religion and secularism, and extremism is on the rise.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In early 2014, I helped host a concert with some of Turkey&rsquo;s pop stars in Xinjiang. Quite a few Uighurs were angry with me, because they believed that we were kuffar for singing and dancing. These people have begun to reject Turkish culture, which is really scary. Just a few years ago, young people in Xinjiang felt a lot of solidarity with Turkey, but people have become increasingly narrow-minded and cannot even tolerate Turkey&rsquo;s secular culture. They want Xinjiang to become another Afghanistan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To read his story in Chinese go <a href=\"http://news.ifeng.com/a/20140507/40186213_0.shtml\">here.</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The original Chinese version can be found here.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>');

If you or someone you are with shows signs of heatstroke, it is extremely important to seek medical help immediately.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How do people get heatstroke?</strong><br />\r\nHeatstroke is common when exercising in very hot and humid weather without drinking enough liquids (known as exertional heatstroke), but also occurs in anyone exposed to heat for too long (especially young children) and people with underlying chronic medical conditions (also known as classic heatstroke). Without timely and proper treatment, heatstroke can lead to death.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are some of the symptoms?</strong><br />\r\nThe most common early signs of heatstroke are heat cramps and heat exhaustion. Heat cramps cause painful muscle cramps; heat exhaustion results in headaches, dizziness, nausea or vomiting, and makes you very thirsty or tired. Other symptoms of heatstroke include: a body temperature in excess of 40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit); warm, red skin; a fast heart rate and rapid breathing; confusion; hallucinations; difficulty walking; seizures; or fainting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Who is most at risk?</strong><br />\r\nInfants, the elderly (over 65 years of age), athletes and outdoor workers are most at risk for heatstroke. The highest fatality rates from heat-related illness are in the elderly population and adults with chronic medical illnesses. Risk factors include: cardiovascular diseases; substance abuse; obesity or diabetes; cognitive disabilities; those taking medications that can impede thermoregulation; and individuals without home air conditioning, especially those with any of the above conditions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What should you do if you are experiencing symptoms?</strong><br />\r\nCool your body down immediately by moving into the shade or an air-conditioned room, taking a cool shower, drinking non-alcoholic or caffeine-free fluids and removing extra clothing. I also recommend placing a cool cloth on the back of the neck and sitting in front of a fan.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can I avoid getting heatstroke?</strong><br />\r\nWhen the weather is hot and/or humid, stay hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids; water and sport drinks are best. Do not overexpose yourself to hot and humid environments (such as a hot car). Wearing loose, light-weight clothing and avoiding layering is also a smart move. If you have to exercise, try to do it early in the day &mdash; before it gets too hot &mdash; and take frequent breaks. And on hot summer days please use your air conditioner!</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// <a href=\"http://shanghai.ufh.com.cn/en/\">Dr. Joseph Chang</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://photographybysong.wordpress.com/2013/01/08/ridiculously-hot-weather-in-perth/\">[image]</a></p>'), ('1', '1', '425', '1', '<p>One normal Sunday morning in our small town of Griffith, New South Wales, when I was 3 and my sister Sandra 5, our daily routine was interrupted by a terribly exciting event.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Without warning, a car pulled up outside our humble fibro house and two men got out, one with a fancy camera. They spoke to our parents and soon, with the photographer snapping away, Sandra was striking the very odd pose of standing at an easel painting a painting, in our front yard.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The next Sunday she was in the big city newspaper, Sydney&rsquo;s Sun-Herald. It wasn&rsquo;t just the most exciting thing to happen to our family &ndash; it was the most exciting thing to happen to our town.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The reason behind her sudden stardom was down to a statewide art prize. A painting of hers had won a local competition, had then been entered at a higher level and was eventually declared &lsquo;Best-in-State.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My two older brothers and I promptly declared the work &ldquo;a load of rubbish.&rdquo; We were brothers. It&rsquo;s what we do.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But the statewide judge positively shot through his beret in excitement about Sandra&rsquo;s piece, which may or may not have been called &lsquo;Woman with Triangular Body and Dress.&rsquo; According to the judge, it showed &ldquo;a rare level perception, a breathtaking honesty and an age-defying sense of neo-cubist bravado.&rdquo; I&rsquo;m embellishing a little, but he definitely said it was &ldquo;honest.&rdquo; Hell, he might have said the painting was truth itself. Good to see my sister hadn&rsquo;t yet learnt to lie through her paintings, aged 5.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We didn&rsquo;t care. We were just agog that Sandra had clearly become our family&rsquo;s ticket out of the working classes. There would be no starving in garrets for us. For the rest of her childhood, with our zealous backing, she was encouraged to pursue her rare gift for painting. And then, once she finished school &ndash; like so many others whose junior artworks are so heavily lauded &ndash; she dropped it like a hot potato.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a funny thing, art. There can be few other pursuits we so eagerly encourage in our youngsters which are so widely abandoned in adulthood. There&rsquo;s calculus, of course, and the recorder, but who misses those when they&rsquo;ve been given up/snapped over your knee?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Children simply must paint paintings, make sculptures, glue collages and stick raw pasta onto paper. It&rsquo;s as if, like dressing yourself or getting food into your mouth, these are skills you can&rsquo;t get through life without. But how many of us find ourselves as adults saying, &ldquo;Oh, I must pick up a new paintbrush,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Hey mate, fancy coming round for some beers and papier-m&acirc;ch&eacute;?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It will, however, be slightly sad if our offspring join the 99 percent who stop doing art when they stop being kids. While it&rsquo;s easy to get carried away with our critiquing, it&rsquo;s a fun thing to do, even if it comes under my mother&rsquo;s headline of &lsquo;Things to occupy your kids until bedtime.&rsquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course there is one defining characteristic of children&rsquo;s art. No, it&rsquo;s not honesty. It&rsquo;s mess. The art gets everywhere. Because of this, there is one vital component every spoiled expat parent needs &ndash; an ayi.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other than that, we once bought a large shower curtain. It gets spread on the kitchen floor, then the kids put brush to paper on top of that.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Now, I&rsquo;m no art expert, but our kitchen has spawned one unquestionable masterpiece: the shower curtain is an artistic tour de force to rival anything of Jackson Pollock&rsquo;s (whose name fittingly lives on in the world of Cockney rhyming slang to describe anything which is &lsquo;bollocks&rsquo;). No matter how hard he tried, the spills and splodges of a couple of kids put Pollock&rsquo;s work in the shade. He just couldn&rsquo;t match their honesty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kids&rsquo; paintings themselves are a mixed bag, like most children&rsquo;s. Some have made it onto the wall. Many have made it into the bin &ndash; a sad martyrdom for their efforts in filling a rainy afternoon. Many started off well but were abandoned halfway through when something else took the artist&rsquo;s fancy, like an ice-cream or an iPad.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, some kids have a natural gift for it. They&rsquo;ll go on to be famous artists. Others, sadly, will have no talent whatsoever. They may also go on to be famous artists.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>I love the absurdity of children&rsquo;s art. I love huge heads on little bodies, fingerless hands on elbow-less arms &ndash; all on 2-D people rendered in the pre-Renaissance or &lsquo;Flat Stanley&rsquo; style. Some more serious art critics could really go to town with it. And it&rsquo;s all done without a hint of hallucinogens, save perhaps for red food coloring.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are some downsides. Some art makes it onto the wall without the involvement of a piece of paper. And occasionally a child can get worked up and miserable if their painting doesn&rsquo;t turn out the way they&rsquo;d hoped.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For this eventuality I have two action plans. First, I&rsquo;ll quote them no less an artist than Salvador Dali: &ldquo;Have no fear of perfection. You&rsquo;ll never reach it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If this fails, I&rsquo;ll show them a Jackson Pollock and tell them it sold for millions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>// Trevor Marshallsea was a foreign correspondent in Beijing in the 1990s and returned a decade later.

AAP provides a variety of information about childhood vaccines.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What are the most commonly recommended vaccinations in Asia?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Current recommendations include hepatitis A, tuberculosis, typhoid fever, Japanese encephalitis and rabies.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Hepatitis B is often missed in adults since the series is typically introduced in childhood. Another vaccine which typically lapses in adults is tetanus, which is recommended every five to 10 years, and if not up to date is typically given with the pertussis booster (Tdap). Unfortunately, this vaccine is currently not available in China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Bacillus Calmette&ndash;Gu&eacute;rin, or BCG, is a controversial vaccine against tuberculosis. However, children under age 5 should be vaccinated, especially if residing in China for a length of time.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is Japanese encephalitis and how can it be avoided?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Japanese encephalitis is a virus carried by mosquitoes. It can cause severe meningitis; the symptoms can initially be very vague flu-like symptoms, such as fever, body aches and headache. It is more prevalent in rural areas, specifically in southern China. There is a vaccine available.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What are the common vaccinations that are required to be taken in a series? How far in advance should these be taken before travel?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Vaccinations in series include hepatitis A, hepatitis B, Japanese encephalitis and rabies. In general, plan at least one month prior to travel, with a minimum of two weeks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>How can one determine whether they should get a particular vaccine or not?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Everyone will need to make their own decisions about receiving recommended vaccinations based on personal situations, such as length of travel and stay, location of travel and activities and severity of complications without vaccination. In general, most vaccinations carry very similar side effects and risks, while the diseases they vaccinate against are very different. Therefore, research the disease you are considering vaccinating against and decide based on probability of being infected, severity of infection and complications and finally, mortality rate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is the quality of vaccinations in Shanghai comparable to elsewhere?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>The quality of vaccinations is generally good, since all local vaccines come from the Shanghai CDC. However, take caution that you receive your vaccine from a reputable hospital to ensure their source is reliable.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Are there any vaccinations that should be withheld from children?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I recommend children receive all required vaccines, in addition to travel- and area-specific vaccinations. This is especially important for children with medical issues, such as preterm infants, asthma and allergies, just to name a few.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Is it safe to receive several vaccinations at the same time?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Much research has shown that whether receiving one or multiple vaccines, the burden on the immune system is the same, so it&rsquo;s best to follow the recommended vaccination schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.naturesfare.com/blog/vaccination-season/\">[image]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>// <a href=\"http://shanghai.ufh.com.cn/en/\">Dr. Maikong Xiong&nbsp;</a></strong></p>'), ('1', '1', '427', '1', '<p>Thinking about volunteering?

In either case we know it&rsquo;s important to educate our children about sex.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A common question parents may have is &ldquo;<a href=\"http://-http://www.webmd.com/sex/features/when-to-talk-to-your-child-about-sex--.\">at what age do I start talking to my children about sex?&rdquo;</a>. The younger, the better. Why? &ldquo;If you talk about sexual matters from the beginning of a child&#39;s use of language, there never needs to be the <em>big</em> birds and bees talk. It&rsquo;s all just a series of small conversations spread out over many years. You, as the parent, become the obvious go-to person whenever there&#39;s a question. If you become an &quot;askable&quot; parent, you will have offered your child an incredibly valuable gift.&rdquo;&nbsp;Your child will become naturally curious about his or her body as they grow older allowing for many opportunities to educate them. For young children, you can start by teaching them the names of their body parts or asking if they know why girls and boys look different.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you get uncomfortable, try your best to forge ahead. Consider that you are a setting the stage for open, honest discussions with your child. If you aren&rsquo;t open and honest they may become reluctant to ask you for advice in the future and will be more likely to turn to their peers for questions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Remember that when we talk to our children about sex, it&rsquo;s a good idea to keep our conversation age appropriate. When you provide age appropriate information it&rsquo;s easier for them to understand.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also, if you haven&rsquo;t talked about sexuality with your children yet - don&rsquo;t worry! It&rsquo;s never too late to open that door. Remember that the most important thing is to be open and available whenever your child wants to talk.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>According to <a href=\"http://www.plannedparenthood.org/parents/talking-kids-about-sex-sexuality-37962.htm\">Planned Parenthood</a> here are some tips when talking to your children about the birds and the bees:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Try to find out what is really being asked</strong>. What seems like a straightforward question might not be. To find out the true nature of the question, we might ask, &ldquo;What have you heard about that?&rdquo; &ldquo;What do you think about that?&rdquo; or &ldquo;Can you tell me what you already know about that?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t answer with too much information</strong>. We can keep answers short and simple and explain new words that our children might not have heard before. After giving an answer, we might encourage our kids to ask us follow-up questions by asking, &ldquo;Is there anything else you would like to know?&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Check their understanding.</strong> After answering a question, we can ask, &ldquo;Does that answer your question?&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some parents worry that they won&rsquo;t know the answers to their children&rsquo;s questions. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine not to know something, or not to have an immediate answer. One of the best ways we can teach our kids about sexuality is to find the answers together and then talk about what we&rsquo;ve learned. Seeking out information together in books, online, or by asking others can help build a respectful and trusting relationship, as well as model how our kids can seek answers on their own.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In addition to having open, honest conversations about sex it&rsquo;s a good idea to have books around the house that your children can freely access. This is particularly the case for teenagers who tend to be more private as they go through puberty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Here are some recommendations:</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Its-Perfectly-Normal-Changing-Growing/dp/0763644846\">It&#39;s Perfectly Normal: Changing Bodies, Growing Up, Sex and Sexual Health</a>&nbsp;by Robie Harris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Its-So-Amazing-Families-Library/dp/0763613215/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401354098&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=It%27s+So+Amazing%3A+A+Book+About+Eggs%2C+Sperm%2C+Birth%2C+Babies%2C+and+Families\">It&#39;s So Amazing: A Book About Eggs, Sperm, Birth, Babies, and Families</a>&nbsp;by Robie Harris.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Sensibility-Thinking-Parents-Talking/dp/0738205206/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1401354124&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Sex+and+Sensibility%3A+The+Thinking+Parent%27s+Guide+to+Talking+Sense+About+Sex\">Sex and Sensibility: The Thinking Parent&#39;s Guide to Talking Sense About Sex</a>&nbsp;by Deborah Roffman.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Sex-Puberty-All-That-Stuff/dp/0764129929\">Sex, Puberty, and All That Stuff: A Guide to Growing Up</a> by Jacqui Bailey</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://thesnapper.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/sex.jpg\">[image]</a></p>'), ('1', '1', '431', '1', '<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Got a kid that can&rsquo;t sleep in the dark because of those horrible, scary monsters?</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Try this trick: Monster spray.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take an old spray bottle and design it however you&#39;d like and tell&nbsp;your child that it&rsquo;s a very serious spray that will kill&nbsp;off <em>any</em> monsters.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A <a href=\"http://gizmodo.com/greatest-pharmacist-ever-prescribes-anti-monster-spray-1541252081\">pharmacist</a> Jeff Dodds in the U.S. took this &lsquo;monster spray&rsquo; to a whole new level when he had a very sleepy six-year-old girl with a monster problem.<em>While at the local Barrett Pharmacy &amp; Variety, a little girl approached Dodds with a not-entirely-medical condition; all those monsters under her bed were keeping her up at night.

There are 2.1 billion people who are obese or overweight, rising from 875 million in 1980. Almost a third of the world is now obese and no country has been successful in lowering the obesity rate since the 1980&rsquo;s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In North Africa and the Middle East 60 percent of men and 65 percent of women are considered obese. The U.S. holds the highest percentage in the world with 13 percent of their population considered to be obese. Almost the equivalent of China and India combined, which stands at 15 percent. It appears there is a <a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/28/obesity-_n_5407038.html\">strong link</a> between income and obesity. The higher the income, the fatter they become. When people become too heavy, they are at a much higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, cancer, stroke, arthritis and a many other types of illness. People seem to be eating more and exercising less. Different parts of the world have unique&nbsp;eating habits, for example South Africa consumes&nbsp;a lot of starchy food, while in parts of Latin America it&rsquo;s more sugary condensed drinks and unhealthy snacks. In China, the introduction of western food and reduction of overall physical activity has created a spike in weight gain. Most bike lanes have been replaced by roads which are stuffed with bumper to bumper traffic.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Rates of obesity tend to be higher for busy career minded women who prioritize their children and work before diet and exercise.

These injuries can happen at any level of the spine, but you most often see them at cervical (neck) and lumbar (low back) regions. In mild cases, you will see localized pain and stiffness in the region. In severe cases, there can be radiating pain or numbness into distal extremities, loss of strength and severe pain spreading through a body region.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Can other serious conditions cause back pain?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Other causes of back pain can be acute or chonic injuries to muscles, arthritis or poor foot and leg biomechanics.&nbsp; But there are also non-spinal conditions, like kidney stones, that can cause severe back pain. It&rsquo;s important for medical staff to determine the root cause of the problem in any situation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What exercises would you recommend for people to do to avoid back problems or recover from a back injury?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>It really depends on the situation, as different issues have different concerns. But generally speaking, for my patients, I initially have them avoid activities with moderate or high impact, a large range of motion or heavy weight bearing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you think equipment such as Swiss balls (for sitting in the office) are useful?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>I think that Swiss balls are a great tool for rehab and exercise. But as with anything else they have to be used correctly or they can cause more problems. So even if you sit on a Swiss ball at work, you may still have problems if you have bad posture and are hunched over a computer all day.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>If back issues are not prevented, what sort of ailments can happen in later life?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>In patients that have had long-term chronic spinal problems, you tend to start seeing degenerative conditions like arthritis, collapsed discs and bone spurs develop.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What treatments and help are available for people with back problems?</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are many available treatments out there for people dealing with back problems. In my practice, I tend to use a combination of manual and exercise therapy. But ultimately it is up to the patient to help themselves.&nbsp; That is why I always educate my patients on good lifestyle choices, good biomechanics and how to be aware of bad habits. It is always best to be self-aware to avoid long term problems.

Having an ayi to help around the house or a driver to ferry you from place to place can make parenting in a foreign land a whole lot easier and more enjoyable. Having help may seem like a unusual luxury but with time, most expats adjust to having the extra hands around and find it an indispensable part of life in the Middle Kingdom.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Ayis</span></strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>An ayi doesn&rsquo;t have a specifically defined role as such &ndash; they may help with your cleaning and laundry a few hours a week or they can do all the cooking, shopping and child care full-time. Every family is unique and must think about their needs and how an ayi can best help.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s also important to spend time creating clear guidelines about your ayi&rsquo;s duties from the start.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Cecile Spirit, a seven-year expat in Shanghai and mother advises, &ldquo;From the beginning, make a list of what you want your ayi to do.&rdquo;&nbsp; She has had positive experiences with the two ayis she has employed here, but many of her friends were not clear about their expectations and ended up in frustrating situations that often lead to the ayi abruptly leaving.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An ayi is not a mind reader, Spirit says, &ldquo;Be frank. Be blunt. If they have done something you don&rsquo;t agree with, tell them.&rdquo; An example Spirit gives is her friend&rsquo;s ayi who would use the same cloth to clean the toilet and the kitchen.&nbsp; &ldquo;You may have to teach them about your hygiene standards and adapting to your family&rsquo;s requirement,&rdquo; she adds.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>For matters of childcare, cultural differences in the way children are raised can also be an issue, so it&rsquo;s equally important to be clear about issues such as discipline, diet, routines and sleep.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Some families will find an ayi most helpful when children are younger, but find their needs often change.&nbsp; This has been the case for Monica Munn, an American mother of three children who has been in Shanghai five years.&nbsp; &ldquo;While having an ayi around is very helpful and there are days that I wished I had more help, as our children get older and go to school, my need for the extra help has diminished,&rdquo; says Munn.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Building a positive relationship with your ayi takes time, but if you properly train and communicate with your ayi, respect them and pay them well, your trust in each other will grow. For Xiao Lin, an ayi from Chongqing who has worked for four families over the past eleven years, says the best part of being an ayi, &ldquo;is feeling like I&rsquo;m part of the family,&rdquo;&nbsp; and she continues to keep in touch with the families who have left China to this day.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best way to find a good ayi is through the recommendation of expat families who are leaving and want to help their ayi find a new home. See p8 for sources for connecting with other parents, or you may even find postings in your housing complex. Hiring an ayi who has worked with other families will make the transition for all parties easier and an ayi with solid references will likely be one you can trust.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Agencies are another option and can arrange interviews at your home with four to five candidates.&nbsp; If you don&rsquo;t speak Mandarin, the agencies can also help translate. From there you begin a trial period - usually a few days - and if you agree to hire the ayi, a contract will be signed. You have to pay a fee to the agency which can range from 10 percent of the monthly salary for local agencies to as high as 40 percent for agencies that cater to foreigners. The benefits of using an agency are having an intermediary should problems arise, and in the event the ayi doesn&rsquo;t work out, they will help you find a replacement without having to pay another fee.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;Here are some suggested questions when interviewing an ayi:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; How long has she worked as an ayi and what were her previous jobs?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; If she looked after children, what were their ages?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; Has she had a health check?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; Does she know first aid?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; Does she speak any English?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Can she cook Chinese or Western food?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>7.&nbsp; &nbsp; Does she have children of her own and do they live with her?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>8.&nbsp; &nbsp; Is she available to work on the weekends?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Drivers</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If your employer doesn&rsquo;t provide a driver and car, which is the case for many expats today, finding a driver can be done in the same way as an ayi &ndash; through a car-leasing agency or the recommendations of other expats.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Besides helping you get to and from work, some drivers drop off and pick up children from school and others might even run errands too.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Here are some important questions to ask of the driver:</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>1.&nbsp; &nbsp; How long has he been a driver?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>2.&nbsp; &nbsp; Has he previously worked for expat families?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>3.&nbsp; &nbsp; What traffic violations or accidents has he had?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>4.&nbsp; &nbsp; What kind of car does he drive?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>5.&nbsp; &nbsp; What hours is he driver available?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6.&nbsp; &nbsp; Does he smoke?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>Cost</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>When employing an ayi or driver, the contract should specify the job responsibilities and conditions of employment, as well as holidays, salary, overtime and bonus in the contract.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Prices of both have been steadily on the rise. If you are paying hourly for an ayi, expect to pay RMB20-25/hour. For a full-time worker, 40 or more hours per week, monthly salaries can range from RMB3800&ndash;4500, sometimes more, depending on their experience and schedule.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Drivers with a car can range from RMB7000-20,000 per month depending on the type of car (sedan or minivan), while gas and tolls cost extra.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both ayi and driver will likely expect to have holidays off, as well as a Chinese New Year&rsquo;s bonus which is typically one month&rsquo;s salary depending on their length of employment. Bear in mind, they will likely expect a salary increase each year too. All of these things can be negotiated, but it&rsquo;s best to be up front at the beginning of employment to avoid future problems.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>**MANDARIN BOX**</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clean 干净 gānj&igrave;ng</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp; Dirty &nbsp; 脏&nbsp; zāng</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull;&nbsp; &nbsp; Wash&nbsp; 洗 xǐ</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once a week &nbsp; 一个星期一次 y&iacute;g&egrave; xīngqī y&iacute; c&igrave;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&bull; &nbsp; &nbsp;Twice a week&nbsp; 一个星期两次 y&iacute;g&egrave; xīngqī liǎng c&igrave;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><u><strong>8 Different Types of Ayi:</strong></u></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The Tie Dayi</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>You used to have white t-shirts.

A quick doze can be the most refreshing way to wake up and enliven your mind when you&rsquo;re feeling spent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Harvard sleep researchers found that power naps can boost productivity, improve memory, jump start creativity and even help lower your risk of heart disease. All well and good, yet why are naps so hit and miss?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, it all depends on how we catch those precious zzz&rsquo;s. The non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep cycle can be divided into four parts: stage one and we&rsquo;re in a light sleep, that weird state between being awake and asleep when we are roused at the drop of a hat.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In stage two, we detach from our surroundings and prepare for deep sleep; our breathing and heart rate is regular and our body temperature lowers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>By stages three and four we&rsquo;re in deep sleep, with stage four being more intense. Your muscles relax and you begin to enter that dream-ridden stage of REM. The first cycle of REM occurs about 90 minutes after you nod off and lasts around 10 minutes, with each period lengthening after each non-REM round.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The difference between a good rest and a bad one is down to which stage you wake up in. The perfect power nap stays in stages one and two; the deep-sleeping stages of three and in particular four are bad news: they play with your body&rsquo;s daily rhythm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ensure you resurface in stages one and two, take naps that are between 20 to 40 minutes long. Having a regular naptime may also help you get to sleep faster and wake up quicker.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><a href=\"http://io9.com/the-science-behind-power-naps-and-why-theyre-so-damne-1401366016\">[image]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '450', '1', '<p><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Photos of a one-year-old &quot;monk&quot; from Xichan Temple in Fuzhou, Fujian province <a href=\"http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/trending/2014-05/27/content_17543667.htm\">went viral</a> as soon as they were posted.

Here&#39;s why:</p>\r\n\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Cleansing is the practice of reducing toxic exposure while supporting the body&rsquo;s natural detoxification pathways. Our lungs, skin, kidneys, liver, lymphatic system and gastrointestinal tract constantly work to protect us from the plethora of toxins present in our modern day lives. Our bodies are designed to handle a certain amount of toxins. However, problems arise, and often illness occurs, when our main organs of detoxification become overburdened.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>When the body is overburdened and not functioning properly, detoxification can become impaired. Toxins then begin to build up, often being stored in our fat tissues. These toxins damage our health and contribute to an endless amount of problems such as weight gain, digestive problems, skin eruptions, allergies, asthma, food and environmental sensitivities, headaches, fatigue&hellip;the list goes on and on. Cleansing allows our cells the opportunity to eliminate waste and repair damage, restoring balance to our bodies.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>SWEAT IT WITH BIKRAM</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140617125113.jpg\" style=\"height:577px; width:632px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you&rsquo;re just not keen on the cleanse, but really want to rid your bod of bad stuff, try a bikram yoga class.

In China, most games are co-ed, as they will be at Beijing Ultimate Summer League. It&rsquo;s a fun and competitive field sport that incorporates elements of basketball, soccer and football, so expect to do a bit of running.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>What can people expect from summer league?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">For the past several years we&rsquo;ve had four teams with about 13 to 15 core players, plus a few pickups every week.

We&rsquo;ve had some people join us in the past who&rsquo;ve never played competitively before but, as we discover, are actually amazing players. So we encourage anyone to come out and try; you just might discover a new passion and hobby!</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Do Ultimate Frisbee players like to party?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">We usually hold a huge party at the end of the summer league, so there&rsquo;s that to look forward to.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Also: yes.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>So anyone can sign up?</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Yes! <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tgBJhCZgzlYMISl0PlXQH7Vm6EBzijsAUn7dZJEI3IA/viewform?usp=send_form\">Sign up here</a> (may need VPN), or <a href=\"https://www.surveymonkey.com/s/M2KBPVY\">here</a> (don&rsquo;t need VPN), or email the organizers (see below).

Found in retinoids, (topical acne treatments prescribed by dermatologists) it promotes cellular turnover, keeping pores clear. Vitamin A deficiencies are linked with dry skin, dry hair, brittle nails, and acne outbreaks. To prevent this consume more dairy like low fat milk, and fish, such as salmon. &nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>B Vitamins</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Vitamin B2 decreases stress, which can help minimize acne flare-ups. Foods high in B2 include leafy, green vegetables, meat, milk, eggs, whole grains and fish. Vitamin B3 is believed to improve circulation, reduce cholesterol, and help metabolize protein, fat and sugar. B3 is found in peanuts, eggs and avocados.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Vitamin E</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Vitamin E is another essential vitamin for skin health. It is known for its antioxidant effects, which enhance tissue repair and healing. Vitamin E can be consumed by eating peanuts, almonds, sunflower seeds, wheat germ, and broccoli.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Vitamin C</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Vitamin C promotes cellular repair, boosts immunity, fights infection, and acne.

A diet high in sugar is linked with lower levels of chromium. Chromium is in beef, liver, eggs, chicken, oysters, wheat germ, green peppers, apples, bananas and spinach.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Omega-3 Fatty Acids</strong>&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Omega-3 fatty acids in fish oil, salmon, and ground flax seed, along with chromium, zinc, and selenium were found to have both anti-acne and mood regulating properties according to an acne study conducted at the Lasky Skin Clinic, (Beverly Hills, CA), in 2008.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><u><strong>Super Foods for Healthy Clear Skin</strong></u></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140623130019.jpg\" style=\"height:340px; opacity:0.9; width:372px\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Kale</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Loaded with vitamins A, B complex, C, E K, as well as manganese, calcium, potassium, iron, magnesium, protein, folate, and phosphorus, kale is really good for you and your skin.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Broccoli</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Vitamins A, B complex, C, E, and K in broccoli repair damaged skin tissue, while the omega 3 fatty acids, calcium and folate support the proper functioning of skin cells.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Tofu</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">The vegetable proteins, calcium, healthy unsaturated fats, antioxidants, iron, copper and manganese in tofu combine to give you healthy skin.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Citrus Fruits</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">As already mentioned citrus fruits are rich in Vitamin C, which facilitate the body&#39;s production of collagen, a protein that forms the basic structure of your skin keeping it firm. Consume oranges,&nbsp;grapefruits, kiwis, and cherries, to help tighten the skin and prevent wrinkles.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Orange, Green and Red Vegetables</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Orange vegetables including carrots and sweet potatoes&nbsp;contain beta-carotene, which our bodies convert into vitamin A, the antioxidant that prevents cell damage, premature aging&nbsp;and acne. Spinach and other green, leafy vegetables will help your skin produce new cells, get rid of the old ones, reduce dryness and keeping your face looking fresh. Tomatoes contain lycopene, which stimulates skin circulation.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Whole Grains and Brown Rice</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Steady blood sugar levels are associated with skin health. Processed sugar and flour can cause an insulin spike, which in turn can encourage acne. Consider switching processed white carbohydrates for whole grains, whole wheat and brown rice.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">They are a good source of B vitamins, protein, selenium and magnesium, and contain several antioxidants that help to regulate your sugar levels by releasing energy slowly overtime.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Dark Chocolate</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Great news for chocolate lovers, dark chocolate does not cause acne. In fact, it is believed to help skin stay hydrated and protected from sun damage. The most effective chocolate for your skin should have at least 60&nbsp;percent cacao.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Nuts and Seeds</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Pumpkin seeds and Brazil nuts contain zinc and selenium. Selenium increases the fighting power and white blood cell count to better fight infections, including those on your face, while vitamin E, copper, magnesium, manganese, potassium, calcium and iron in nuts and seeds are essential to good skin health and function.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Dark Berries</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Berries are rich in antioxidants, which we already know are great for your skin. The fiber in dark berries help to regulate insulin production as well.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\"><strong>Water</strong></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Water flushes toxins out of your body and replenishes your skin cells.

Studies indicate that along with protecting you against cancer, heart disease, osteoporosis,&nbsp;and facilitating weight loss, green teas also help prevent skin cancer and&nbsp;signs of aging. Antioxidants bind to free radicals and deactivate them before they can cause harm to your skin. The polyphenols in green teas, namely catechins, are effective against skin inflammation, acne, and cancerous changes in the skin.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><span style=\"font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif\">Acne is unwelcomed at any age, but especially for tweens and teens who are already self-conscious with the changes taking place in their bodies. The hormonal fluctuations during this time are believed to contribute to acne out outbreaks. As a nutritionist I believe that eating a healthy balanced diet of fruits and vegetables, lean meats, fish and vegetables proteins, whole grains, and low fat dairy provides us with all the essential vitamins and nutrients for overall good health. It should come as no surprise that these foods are also good for our skin.

After a particularly stressful day at work, rather than slumping into the couch, switching on the TV and munching a bag of Doritos, take a walk outside. Go for a run.

Visitors came to us from the States, China, Australia and many European countries.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Do you listen to music to relax? Can you ever listen to music and not think about the mechanics of it?</strong><br />\r\nI don&#39;t listen to music that I conduct or would consider conducting or that I play as a pianist. I don&#39;t listen to any of that kind of music to relax because it will engage my conscious mind. I listen to chamber music quite a lot, I listen to baroque music which I know very little about and intend to keep it that way so at least there&#39;s one area of music I can listen to just to relax. But see, I can&#39;t listen to music passively. I lost that facility probably about 25 years ago. It&#39;s impossible for me to have background music. Music is never in the background for me; if there&#39;s music playing then I am drawn into it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>What is the most frequently played piece of music on your MP3 player or in your CD collection?</strong><br />\r\n<em>Die Winterreise</em> by Schubert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>As a female conductor, what is the greatest difficulty and obstacle you&rsquo;ve had to overcome?</strong><br />\r\nNot an obstacle &ndash; not an issue. Completely irrelevant.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Have you ever been to China before? What are you planning to do while here?</strong><br />\r\nNo, in fact, this will be my first visit to China. I am very much looking forward to meeting Chinese audiences &ndash; and of course to visiting many museums and historic buildings. I would also like to sample the regional cuisines of the cities that we are visiting.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>You will be conducting the Vienna Symphony on your trip this month. What about this orchestra impresses you the most? </strong><br />\r\nThe Wiener Symphoniker have a long tradition of playing the great classical repertoire. Their sound and style is especially powerful in the German romantic repertoire, so our programs for this tour should showcase the orchestra&rsquo;s strengths.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Beethoven&rsquo;s &lsquo;Symphony No. 7&rsquo; is one of two pieces you are scheduled to conduct in Guangzhou. Can you remember how you were introduced to this piece?</strong><br />\r\nI first heard a piano arrangement of the second movement when I was a child, beginning to learn the piano. I found the music very disturbing &ndash; emotional and dark. As I have now conducted it many times, this early impression of darkness and sadness has remained. It is a very deeply moving work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>The other piece you are conducting is Beethoven&rsquo;s &lsquo;Symphony No. 3,&rsquo; a dramatic, operatic symphony. It&#39;s been said this symphony had a great impact on Wagner&#39;s </strong><strong><em>Tristan and Isolde</em></strong><strong>. What do you think of this opinion?</strong><br />\r\nI think much of Wagner is inspired by Beethoven, as are the symphonies of Brahms and Bruckner. Beethoven&rsquo;s grand structures, dramatic and darkly emotional melodies were surely the ancestors of Wagner&rsquo;s deeply romantic work.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// June 2, 8pm, RMB180-2,080. Xinghai Concert Hall, 33 Qingbo Lu, Ersha Island, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou 广州市二沙岛晴波路33号 (8735 2222 ext. 886, <a href=\"http://www.concerthall.com.cn\" target=\"_blank\">www.concerthall.com.cn</a>)</em></p>\r\n</div>'), ('1', '1', '468', '2', '<div class=\"arcbody\">\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">In China, there is a famous song that almost all kids can recite called &lsquo;Shishang Zhiyou Mama Hao&rsquo; (世上只有妈妈好, commonly translated in English as &lsquo;Mom is the Best&rsquo;). The fact that nearly every child is taught this ditty reflects the national view that mothers should be honored as selfless and devoted figures &ndash; a belief that has been held throughout Chinese history.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">However, not every mom in the Middle Kingdom is praised so highly. In today&rsquo;s China, the public marginalizes a growing group: female single parents.&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">In the last decade, their ranks have swelled at a phenomenal pace. According to Redinblack.net, a Chinese website that aims to raise public awareness about single moms, there are currently over 20 million women in China raising children alone. This figure is expected to rise by three million annually in the coming years.</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">&nbsp;</div>\r\n\r\n<div style=\"clear:both;\">There are three kinds of single moms in China: unmarried women, divorced women and widowed women. No matter which category a female falls into, they face more or less the same difficulties.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>One of the most serious problems faced by all single moms is the high cost of living, and of all regular expenses, the cost of their children&rsquo;s schooling makes up the largest chunk. In 2013, figures from the Guangzhou Women&rsquo;s Federation revealed that there were 6,190 single moms in Guangzhou registered as living in poverty, of whom 68 percent were reported to be additionally burdened due to the high cost of tuition fees, which is normally RMB1,500 per month.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Little or no support from ex-husbands, the inability to work due to being a stay-at-home mother and a lack of sufficient education have made it even harder for single moms to make ends meet.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Lin Cuijuan divorced her husband in 2006 and took custody of their son, who was diagnosed with autism at the age of 6. In order to shoulder her monthly rent of RMB900 and the RMB1,600 for the specialist school her son attends, Lin has to work three jobs, toiling away from 4am to 10pm every day. &ldquo;I feel really tired, since my son fully relies on me. But seeing him receiving a proper education, I feel happy and satisfied,&rdquo; says Lin.&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Another prominent issue affecting single moms involves the difficult of embarking on fresh relationships and finding a new spouse. A traditional Chinese saying goes: &ldquo;A good woman never marries a second husband (好女不嫁二夫),&rdquo; and the stigma attached to remarrying is still very prevalent.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In the PRC, many people brand divorced women as second-hand goods whose value has been lost; unmarried women with kids as corrupted; and widowed women as bad luck. A recent five-year survey following 100 divorced couples in Beijing revealed over a half of the interviewed males had re-married while just 15 percent of the females had found a husband.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Aside from financial and societal pressures, single moms also worry about what their children will think if they remarry. An online survey conducted by Sina.com showed that about 60 percent of the women asked would only accept a proposal from a man if their kids were okay with it.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;My daughter is important to me,&rdquo; says Ms. Fang, a 45-year-old single mom and a head nurse working in Guangzhou. &ldquo;If she says no, I will definitely not marry again.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With China&rsquo;s increasing divorce rate and growing numbers of monetarily unstable single mothers, more attention has been focused on this previously overlooked group. In Guangzhou, for instance, the Guangzhou Women&rsquo;s Federation set up the Single Moms Rose Project in 2012 to empower women to learn new skills and achieve economic independence, as well as helping them to find their Mr. Right at matchmaking events. A sub-branch of this organization, the Liwan Women&rsquo;s Federation, arranges job-training classes for poor single mothers living in Liwan district.</p>\r\n</div>'), ('1', '1', '469', '2', '<p>&quot;When my friends in [Chinese] public schools look at my maths homework, they&rsquo;re amazed how easy it is; they can work out the solutions in seconds,&rdquo; says 16-year-old Seline Wang, who&rsquo;s studying for her IGCSEs at one of Shenzhen&rsquo;s international schools.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Wang&rsquo;s experience is indicative of the disparity in numeracy between China and England, a phenomenon that has consistently hit British headlines this year following a report released by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). The December 2013 OECD report revealed that children of cleaners in Shanghai outperform the children of doctors and lawyers in England in math; moreover, the children of unskilled parents in England are a whopping two-and-a-half years behind their Shanghainese counterparts.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Specifically, China (Shanghai), Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan sit attentively in the top four global seats according to OECD statistics compiled in 2012. English-speaking countries perform comparatively poorly: America snoozes at the back with its feet on the desk, ranking at 36, while its cousins seem to be awake but looking out of the window, picking their noses &ndash; Canada, Australia, Ireland and England saunter in at 13th, 19th, 20th and 26th respectively.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, England and its reactionary media felt the math gap so acutely that UK Education Minister Liz Truss knee-jerked a response in early 2014. Her stroke of misguided genius? Ship in 60 teachers from China to show the bewildered youth of England the path to Pythagoras! Unfortunately political grandstanding in this manner fails to get to the cultural heart of the matter: why do Chinese students really perform better at math? Can Chinese methods be applied in the West? And &ndash; more abstractly &ndash; do superior math exam skills translate to GDP growth?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The gap in mathematical capabilities between some (but not all) Asian countries and English-speaking nations rests with a mix of parental expectations, cultural attitudes towards math and &ndash; to a minor extent &ndash; teaching methodologies. Rather than a genetic predisposition to math superiority, the above cultural factors combine into the core reason for Chinese students&rsquo; success: practice, practice and more practice.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of what parents demand from their offspring, a clear gulf exists between East and West. Research by the Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development (ASCD) reveals that while American and Chinese fathers estimate similar scores in math for their children, &ldquo;American parents, teachers and students hold markedly lower standards for academic achievement than do their counterparts in Asia.&rdquo; In contrast, a 2014 study by sociologists Jennifer Lee and Zhou Min targeting Chinese and Vietnamese parents reveals that most Asian parents believe &ldquo;A is for average and B is an Asian fail.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Research by Hong Kong University analyzed the role of parents in math learning based on a survey comprising 198 students in Hangzhou. The study concluded that &ldquo;parental expectations for their children and involvement in their children&#39;s mathematics learning were two major factors which influence children&#39;s educational expectations for themselves [and] attitudes toward mathematics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attitude toward math in China, however, extends beyond pushy &lsquo;tiger moms&rsquo; that force hardcore workloads on their kids. It embodies a cultural mindset about math and its role in education as a bridge to a better life. With experience in both Asia and Britain, Fan Langhuo, Professor of Education at the UK&rsquo;s University of Southampton, believes that, &ldquo;In China, all parents know that maths is the number one subject in schools&hellip; In Britain, students&rsquo; attitudes are different. They feel it&#39;s alright if they say they don&rsquo;t like mathematics.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In fact, cultural attitudes seem to be far more important in explaining performance disparity than exaggerated differences in teaching methodologies or genetic predisposition. <em>USA Today</em> cites the following findings from research in 2013: &ldquo;The News-Press traveled this summer to Asia, where students &ndash; on paper &ndash; are running circles around American children, especially in math and science. Five countries and nearly 25,000 miles later, one revelation became clear: a math class there is the same as a math class here, only in a different language.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Pushed by their parents&rsquo;, teachers&rsquo; and society&rsquo;s expectations, Chinese students complete math homework ad nauseum and, in the process, rote-learn how to tackle exam questions. Public school student Tom Zhang, 16, tells us that the Chinese method has both drawbacks and strengths: &ldquo;If you deviate from the way the teacher does things or suggest something new, teachers get annoyed. But learning in this way is very thorough and provides an excellent foundation for further study and branching out at university.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>IGCSE, a British-based curriculum, doesn&rsquo;t seem that different &ndash; it just moves at a slower pace and so doesn&rsquo;t get as advanced. Student Seline Wang feels it suits students who lack a natural affinity with math. &ldquo;IGCSE suits me because it gives a better understanding of why a formula is used,&rdquo; she says, &ldquo;but it&rsquo;s not as advanced as what students are learning in China&rsquo;s public schools.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Thus, the major difference between the curricula in China and &ndash; in this case &ndash; Britain seems to lie with aiming for gold rather than any innate racial capability. China teaches towards the high end of the class, which forces all students to raise their game and drives up exam scores. Conversely, England teaches towards the middle of the pack, if not the lower end. As OECD statistics and national attitudes seem to evidence, the UK approach decreases competition, makes it okay to go for bronze and leads to patchy assessment performance. For example, in April this year the British press praised the &ldquo;high performance&rdquo; of spectacular mediocrity when its students came in 11th in international problem-solving tests.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In terms of economic value, critics state that China&rsquo;s outstanding math scores are part of the locally acknowledged &lsquo;gaokao dineng&rsquo; equation &ndash; &lsquo;high scores, low ability.&rsquo; In his article, &lsquo;Why China isn&rsquo;t a threat yet: The cost of high scores,&rsquo; educational writer Zhao Yang notes the importance of the &ldquo;products of education,&rdquo; which encompass attainments in life and work. Zhao expands on something he feels is missing in China: &ldquo;The quality of education by school-related factors, such as test scores, should consistently predict the performance of school graduates in society.&rdquo; He believes this is not the case because students&rsquo; paper abilities and the skills that industry actually requires are worlds apart.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Both England and America are guilty of glorifying China&rsquo;s educational achievements; China to an extent does the same in reverse by positioning Western universities as the Holy Grail for its students.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In Britain&rsquo;s case, importing 60 Chinese math teachers will not inspire the nation&rsquo;s youth to start doing math homework till past midnight, change parental attitudes overnight or lead the government to recognize &ndash; as it did 30 years ago &ndash; the importance of rote-learning as a valuable tool for giving students a strong foundation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In China&rsquo;s case, an over-emphasis on rote-learning and exam results will continue to lead global league tables, but might not produce leading scientists, researchers or individuals that can look back on a happy school life while thriving in the work place.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In math, the differences in teaching methodologies and genetic predisposition between East and West are overplayed. It boils down to a case of hard work inspired by cultural and familial expectations intertwined with intense competition: Chinese students simply practice far more for exams and move through the curriculum much faster.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Regardless of which approach is better or leads to a more robust economy, if countries such as England continue to eschew rote-learning and take a softly-softly approach to schooling, China&rsquo;s exam results will remain much higher.</p>');

But hair is fragile and too much heat and bad hair products can cause split ends, sun damage, tangles and broken brittle pieces. This summer,it&#39;s time to take charge of your hair&#39;s health. Developing these habits over time will set you down the road to recovery. Follow these simple tips, courtesy of stylists at Toni &amp; Guy next to Taikoo Hui, Guangzhou to maintain healthy hair.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Wash oily hair more frequently </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How often you wash your hair should be based on how much oil your scalp produces. If your scalp is oily, you may need to wash it as often as once a day. If you have chemically treated hair, your hair may be drier, so you may want to wash it less frequently. As you get older, your scalp makes less oil, so you may not need to shampoo as often. But if you see flakes in your hair, you may not be shampooing enough. This can lead to dandruff and other scalp diseases.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Choose a shampoo and conditioner formulated specifically for your hair type </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>For example, if you color your hair, use a shampoo designed for color- treated hair. When washing your hair, concentrate on cleaning primarily the scalp, rather than washing the entire length of hair. Washing only your hair can create flyaway hair that is dull and coarse. Use conditioner after every shampoo and concentrate it only on the tips of the hair. Using a conditioner increases shine, decreases static electricity, improves strength and offers some protection from harmful UV rays.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Protect hair when swimming</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Protect your hair from the damaging effects of chlorine by wetting and conditioning your hair before swimming. Wear a tight-fitting swim cap and use a specially formulated shampoo and deep conditioner after swimming to replace lost moisture.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ban the burn</strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p>How to ensure that you don&#39;t fry while you dry? Remove the nozzle from your blow dryer and move it around a lot so as not to cook one spot directly! As long as you&#39;re pointing your dryer downward, you&#39;ll get the same effect, but the heat will be more diffused.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Eat well</strong>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The best follicle fuel is Omega-3 fatty acids, found in cold- water fish like salmon and protein found in nuts and cheese.</p>'), ('1', '1', '496', '2', '<p>Every now and then, you hear a story that&rsquo;s equal parts pain and joy, weakness and strength, fear and bravery, despair and hope. This is the poignant story of the Weir Davis&rsquo; family.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;The best things in life are worth waiting for.&rdquo; And it couldn&rsquo;t be truer than for Scott and Katherine Weir-Davis.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After eleven years of marriage, Britons Katherine and Scott Weir-Davis decided that they were ready to embrace parenthood. But life had other plans for the couple, who were living and working in Spain at the time. Five years and eight unsuccessful IVF cycles later, they decided that adoption was their only hope of becoming parents. On paper, China seemed like a viable and quick option. They were told that the process would take about nine months. But months turned to years and they were still waiting. &ldquo;We were a British couple, living in Spain, wanting to adopt from China. It was very complicated. I was getting ill from all the IVF treatments and it was both an emotional and physical rollercoaster,&rdquo; recalls Katherine.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>After being told it would be at least another two years before they received a baby they made up their minds. They would head to China, spend a year learning the culture and language and then return to Spain to receive a baby. However, after settling into life in Guangzhou, they quickly realised that they would like to stay for more than one year. But again, life was about to throw them another curve ball. &ldquo;Once we had made the decision to stay in Guangzhou, we were told that we had to transfer our adoption application to a local agency. This further complicated our case. All we wanted was a baby to call our own.&rdquo; By now, it had been several years and the Weir-Davis&rsquo; were exhausted. With nothing to lose, they travelled to the adoption headquarters of the CCAA in Beijing, for answers.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>6 weeks after that fateful trip to Beijing, they got a call. A 14-month old baby girl had been matched to them. Abandoned by her birth mother at just ten days old, she was at the Huazhou Social Welfare Centre. They were ecstatic; they were finally going to be parents. Scott remembers the moment they first laid eyes on her. &ldquo;We had already decided that we were going to name her Rosie. In the first picture that the agency sent us, she was propped up on a cushion strewn with little roses. It was a sign and immediately, we were in love. Rosie was already ours in our hearts.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Six weeks later, on 30th May 2011, they finally became parents. &ldquo;When we saw her for the first time, we couldn&rsquo;t believe it. The moment she was placed in our arms, we knew we were complete. I also realized that I didn&#39;t need to give birth to a child to be a mum,&rdquo; says Katherine. It was the culmination of an incredibly long journey for the Weir-Davis&rsquo; and the start of a beautiful family life.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The couple, who still call Guangzhou home, say that they have no current plans of leaving. Katherine is the Head of Lower School at The British School of Guangzhou and Scott works in export sales.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>A proud mother, Katherine lights up when she talks about Rosie. &ldquo;She&rsquo;s so inquisitive, so full of life. But of course, the questions are inevitable. She often talks about &lsquo;being away&rsquo; as a baby, as if she knows that she&rsquo;s adopted. But she&rsquo;s just four years old. She&rsquo;s our baby. She is everything that we have ever wanted and more, and we will do everything possible as her parents to protect and love her for the rest of our lives...&rdquo;</p>'), ('1', '1', '497', '2', '<p>For years, Hong Kong residents have nursed complaints about the growing parade of visitors to their city from Mainland China. The appeal of Hong Kong, a former British colony, is understandable. Medical care here is far superior to what is found in most of China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Until last year, Mainland mothers were allowed to deliver in Hong Kong, which meant residency for the child and accompanying benefits, including free education and for some, the avoidance of fines for breaching China&#39;s one-child policy. Now, they must be married to a permanent resident or have valid working visas in Hong Kong in order to deliver there.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>But it&#39;s not just locals wanting to cross the border for baby. Ask any expat Mom and chances are that she has or knows someone that has had a bad experience. It just can&rsquo;t be helped. With language barriers and different systems (read: hygiene, bedside manner, post-partum food and habits, reliance on C-sections, archaic technology and plenty more) in place, many expat mothers simply opt to deliver in Hong Kong, as it means English-speaking doctors, Western style bedside manners and most of all, clarity. Home is often too far away and many have demanding jobs and, other kids in school. They also have a desire to ensure that Dad can hop on a train and reach Hong Kong in less than three hours. Hong Kong is thus the perfect option. For some, it&rsquo;s a no-brainer. For others, it wasn&rsquo;t quite what they expected.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Tom Charleston and Mary Lee, who hail from America and Shenzhen respectively, found that going to Hong Kong was much more difficult and expensive than expected. The couple chose to deliver their son in Hong Kong two years ago, after hearing some horror stories from other families about the local medical system. She remarks, &ldquo;Once we confirmed my fetus had a heartbeat, we had to pay a deposit to the private hospital immediately. I was only seven weeks pregnant. I had to keep returning every three to four weeks for my appointments. It was really stressful.&quot; Lee had to relocate to Hong Kong six weeks before her due date and the serviced apartment cost them HKD25,000 a month. When she went into labor around 6am, her doctor was not able to arrive in time as he was booked up for scheduled C-sections. Her son Max was born via emergency C-section a few hours later as the nurses were gettingtoo impatient. She was not given a private room due to lack of space. Lee admits that she had to wait almost six weeks after the birth for Max&rsquo;s passport and visa to be sorted before she could return home. &ldquo;I had hired a domestic helper to help with the chores but even then, I felt so overwhelmed. My husband could not take so much time off from his job in Shenzhen. Even though we claimed back most of the hospital expenses via our insurance broker, we ended up spending an additional HKD80,000. In retrospect, I wish I had stayed in Shenzhen. At least I would have been home and had my husband and family by my side.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>There are also many families who choose to deliver in the PRD but seek second opinions when clarity and further testing is required. Hong Kong does not have restrictions on revealing the baby&rsquo;s gender and plenty of state-of-the-art screenings procedures are available, such as fetal DNA testing. During our interviews, many of the mothers who delivered in China said that they made trips to Hong Kong for specific tests and second opinions.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Whatever your choice, remember that options are always available.

Muslims fast from dawn until sunset, during the day they refrain from consuming food, drinking any liquids, smoking, and engaging in sexual behaviour. Some may also refrain from swearing.

It keeps them unambitious outside of work.

Practicing tai chi is said to support a healthy balance of yin and yang, thereby aiding the flow of qi.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Taichi doesn&rsquo;t care if you are in your 80&rsquo;s or you are 8, anyone can join in on Taichi.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">// Tonight, July 3, 3:30-5:00pm, Jianwai SOHO Building 9, Room 605, 50RMB/person</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">For more information contact them at:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Tel: 5869 5800</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Email: info@chinaledu.com</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">www.chinaledu.com</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140703151903.gif\" style=\"height:550px; width:550px\" /></p>'), ('1', '1', '515', '1', '<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Join The Bookworm tonight for an interesting performance by Jennifer Wong.

Beijing, China&rsquo;s political capital, is where the future will be partly decided and packaged and presented to large swaths of the globe. Even a few of the foreign denizens of the financial capital, Shanghai, tell me they&rsquo;d rather move to Beijing, if only to better grease the palms of those who actually wield power, the functionaries of China&rsquo;s Communist Party. I&rsquo;ve met many Europeans who proudly announce that they&rsquo;ve never in their entire lives visited New York. To participate in the 21st century and not know Beijing will require similar pride. Or foolishness. In fact, the saddest flight in the world is from America&rsquo;s decrepit Newark Liberty International Airport, essentially a giant bathroom with airplanes, to the gleaming and sinuous Norman Foster&ndash;designed Beijing Capital International Airport.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">I&rsquo;d been preparing for Beijing&rsquo;s notorious pollution, stocking up on every asthma inhaler known to man, but on my visit I get lucky. Most of it coincides with the Two Sessions of the National People&rsquo;s Congress and Chinese People&rsquo;s Political Consultative Conference. In preparation for these grand f&ecirc;tes, the pollution around the capital magically dissipates, and the air, while not British-Columbia-fresh, smells merely like an older dog after exertion. The Two Sessions brings Communist partyers from all over the land to Beijing, but if you were picturing dour Maoists in polyester suits, you don&rsquo;t know the New China! The locals call this &ldquo;Beijing Fashion Week,&rdquo; and China&rsquo;s Netizens have a ball checking out the latest in Communist apparel, noting attendees clad in the latest Herm&egrave;s leather belt (20,000 yuan, or about $3,000), or toting the finest Herm&egrave;s Birkin bag (about $16,000). But let&rsquo;s not forget the standard Chanel necklaces and the all-important Bottega Veneta leather briefcase. No wonder a ramble through the still-shockingly-stunning Forbidden City ends in a man-made jumble of rock called the Hill of Accumulated Elegance. If only I had paid more attention during my Introduction to Marxist Thought seminars at Oberlin College, I too could have been zipping around town in one of the long black Audi A8&rsquo;s to which the ruling elites are quite partial (&ldquo;Audi, the official car of official corruption,&rdquo; a local tells me), instead of huffing along in one of the ubiquitous Volkswagen Santana cabs. But this is true of Beijing: everything here is political, down to which karaoke bar you frequent and which ethnic noodles you slurp down. You stand there in the middle of Tiananmen Square, watching Jumbotrons play patriotic music as images of Tibet, Macao, and Taiwan (who knew the island nation had already rejoined the mainland?) flash by, watching the lampposts with their dozens of loudspeakers and hundreds of CCTV cameras watching you. It&rsquo;s all out of scale, and out of sync, and then suddenly you see a two-year-old boy barely tottering on his feet, but already coming up to everyone he meets with a smile and a handshake. &ldquo;Future party leader,&rdquo; says my friend Lilly Kam.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Read more about Gary&rsquo;s adventure in Beijing&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.travelandleisure.com/travel-blog/carry-on/2014/5/22/beijing-fast-forwards-to-the-future\" style=\"font-size: 13px; line-height: 1.6em;\">here.</a></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140704110228.jpg\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>[Photos via&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/alex.gregoiredenicourt?fref=photo\">Alex Gr&eacute;goire-Denicourt]</a></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '518', '1', '<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">Head over to the Traders Upper East Hotel this Sunday with your family for all sorts of kid-friendly activities!

National Cancer Institute of Bethesda has conducted many clinical trials showing that acupuncture can help to increase the number of white blood cells - one of the key indicators of the strength of human body&rsquo;s immunity system. It has also reported that acupuncture can help to enhance white blood cell activities and functions.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Chinese Herbal Medicine - In TCM, herbs are often combined in formulas and given as teas, capsules, liquid extracts, granules, or powders. Although there are many herbs that boost immunity, here are some common ones:</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Huang Qi (Astragalus)</strong> - Very well known for its powerful capacity to stimulate the immune system, and it&rsquo;s ability to increase the number of white blood cells. Recent research has confirmed that astragalus contains antioxidants and has antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties. It can help to lower blood pressure and increase endurance.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Ginseng </strong>- A common root enhances healing and rejuvenation. Ginseng also removes toxins from the body, boosts the immune system and decrease fatigue.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Echinacea</strong> - Often used in tinctures or powders to reduce symptoms of the common cold and flu. It is also used for infections, particularly those of the kidney.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Garlic</strong> - A common part of Chinese cuisine. It is used to reduce cholesterol levels and blood pressure, as well as for treating infections.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Ginger</strong> - Commonly used to reduce nausea, to reduce symptoms of colds and chills through sweating and to boost circulation.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Gingko </strong>- Most commonly used to improve memory.

First, he mixes iodine, pigments and paint preservatives with water in a bathtub at an exact temperature.

Well, not like gold, with gold. Golden algae, to be precise, harvested from waters around the Brehat islands, off the coast of Brittany.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>This unique species forms the basis for Revive Spa&rsquo;s Marine Gold Therapy (RMB1,380/180 minutes), which employs products from Germaine de Capuccini. As well as adding an extra veneer of superficial glamour, the golden algae are also imbued with anti-aging properties and function as an effective after-sun treatment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Once the golden algae cream has been applied, visitors are immersed in a warm water bed, which opens up the pores and elicits more effective absorption. Good for easing back and neck strain, lying in the undulating cocoon feels rather like being gently rocked to sleep in a beach hammock.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Unlike most wraps, the Gold Sun Therapy does not require a rinse off afterwards. Instead, clientele are treated to a full-body massage, followed by the application of further cream to keep the skin shining with health.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If the whole process reminds you rather uncomfortably of Jill Masterson&rsquo;s death in <em>Goldfinger</em>, never fear: Revive offers equally intriguing body wraps that employ wine, chocolate and coffee.

The moment you walk into the doctor&rsquo;s office, your stomach will be exposed to some firm squeezing, twisting and rubbing to determine what kind of fat you are packing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>As Dr. He Lusi explains, blood tests are first done to rule out diabetes and to identify which internal organ may be the cause. This will also decide the placement of the acupuncture needles &ndash; if the spleen function is weak, points along the body will be chosen to strengthen it. This type of acupuncture can be a touch painful, unlike routine sessions, as wind or humidity is driven out of the body.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>If you are looking for a quick fix, TCM cannot help you. Dr. He explains it is best to treat it as a program, and she insists that exercise must be done 20 minutes a day to complement the 30 rounds of acupuncture that are the norm, while assuring results will be seen.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the plus side, with TCM weight loss you don&rsquo;t have to battle with your diet. &ldquo;Eat anything, just not too much of it,&rdquo; says Dr. He. Over-eating is symptomatic of a problem with the stomach that acupuncture can also sort out.<br />\r\nThere are simpler solutions for those who show no underlying problem &ndash; a bit of jelly in the belly responds to massage well, which will improve circulation and disperse wind caught in the fat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Excess blubber can also be affected by panty preference. The Chinese believe that precious qi leaves the body right below the belly button. Low-rise underwear popular with the modern woman is therefore a great source of loss of qi, according to Dr. He, making it harder for the body to get rid of tummy fat.

Unsurprisingly considering the open policy, Xingfu Exchange is home to a wide range of decorations, electronics and accessories, from a 1980s Hitachi TV set and a 1970s Zhonghua gramophone to ceramic piggybanks, silver earrings and leather bags. Even though almost all things at the shop are secondhand, they are always clean and in good shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Before visitors can begin trading in their unwanted knickknacks, Lun assesses what value their goods have. Once this is done, customers choose from items which are of the same value. For example, your antique tape recorder can be traded for a vintage typewriter. With so many hidden gems waiting to be found, the shop also attaches price to everything so that customers who have nothing to exchange can still purchase a great find.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the right side of the shop&rsquo;s entrance hangs a big board with lots of memos stuck to it. &ldquo;Although quality is what I value, I also cherish the memories hidden behind things.

Their children, Melody, 13, and Max, 15, are educated at home.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Dissatisfied with traditional schools, the Mings decided to take their children&rsquo;s education into their own hands two years ago. Their two children are taught the bare basics in English using books from America and Singapore. Locally hired tutors teach the licensed local school curriculum and more specialist topics in Mandarin for five hours a day during the week. Mary also assigns monthly research projects and sends the children to swimming, music, art and English classes, all timetabled in their weekly lesson plans.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our children did not really enjoy going to school. They spent all day with their heads in their books, memorising concepts without being truly stimulated. We could not bear to see them like that,&rdquo; explains Mary. &ldquo;We wanted them to be bilingual, to learn through inquiry, to be challenged and motivated. They do get lonely sometimes, but we try to get them involved in regular group activities to meet friends.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>While industry experts have raised concerns that homeschooling can have a negative impact on psychological development due to the lack of communication with peers, the upside is that it encourages self-directed learning and time for play, exercise and art &ndash; concepts crowded out in many local schools to make time for academics in order to &lsquo;win at the starting line,&rsquo; a local phrase coined to describe the obsession with obtaining the best educational resources starting as early as possible.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It appears that the Mings are not going at this alone. More and more Chinese parents, especially those from regions like Guangdong, Beijing and Zhejiang, are choosing homeschooling. According to the latest report by the 21st Century Education Research Institute, a Beijing-based NGO, roughly 18,000 people are considering practicing homeschooling in the Mainland, with more than 2,000 already doing so. The top reason respondents gave for their decision was dissatisfaction with the rigid local educational pedagogy, followed by the pace and content of lessons, lack of respect for children, aversion to school life, religious intentions and other factors like abuse and punishment.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In theory, however, Chinese law does not allow for homeschooling. The Compulsory Education Law, promulgated in 1986, mandates nine years of education for all children beyond kindergarten at registered schools, whether public or private. But official oversight and other legal loopholes have allowed more parents to homeschool their children, in an effort to emulate the success of programs around the world. In America, for example, 3.4 percent of the school-age population, or 1.77 million students, are homeschooled.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In particular, there are very well-organized Canadian homeschooling movements, which have been adopted by many expat families living here in China. Hailing from the Great White North, Patrick and Sofia Lynch, who have resided in Guangzhou for several years, are very passionate about homeschooling their eight children.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;We are keen to discover each of their qualities and interests and see how to enhance them, as well as how to help them overcome their weak points,&rdquo; says Sofia. &ldquo;We have also had many amazing friends who have lent their skills and time to help with certain aspects of teaching.&rdquo; The oldest two of the eight are currently registered in Canada as online high school home learners, in order for them to transit back to their native land when university beckons.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The concept of homeschooling and its many benefits may be slowly gaining acceptance in the Middle Kingdom, but whether this can go beyond a fad remains in question. With little encouragement from the wider community and few precedents in place to support their cause, progressive families like the Mings know that it&rsquo;s going to be a rough road ahead for their children, especially when it comes to applying to local universities. For example, home-based learning students are unable to acquire certificates issued by registered schools &ndash; a must for those preparing to sit national university entrance examinations, known as the gaokao. Melody and Max Ming have to pass an extremely difficult exam issued by individual universities for students who haven&#39;t completed local school, a nearly impossible feat considering the competition.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;For now, it doesn&rsquo;t look like I have a choice but to send the children to universities overseas. There&rsquo;s no looking back now because they don&rsquo;t have the certificates. They will not be recognized as being educated locally. But that is a risk we are both willing to take for the sake of their well-being and future,&rdquo; says an optimistic Mary. &ldquo;Homeschooling has worked successfully in other countries around the world so I am confident that it will also work for us.&rdquo;</p>'), ('1', '1', '545', '3', '<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<div class=\"arcbody\">\r\n<p><em>Photos by Claire Zheng</em></p>\r\n\r\n<p>Known for efficient service and affordable prices, cha chaan teng (literally &lsquo;tea restaurants&rsquo;) have always been highly ranked on Guangzhouers&rsquo; lists of places to eat. An import from Hong Kong, as the population of such diners has expanded, so locals have become increasingly picky about where to go for their authentic HK fix.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Located on Huale Lu in the Taojin area, Hong Kong Bistro hopes to tap into that market by offering a precise cha chaan teng replica. Decked out in bright orange tones, its wallpaper is composed of nostalgic Hong Kong ads and distinct street views. Piled red plastic crates with glass bottles of Coca Cola, the open beverage bar and a continual stream of Hong Kong TV programs on the goggle-box all feed into the restaurant&rsquo;s ambiance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The attention to details continues with the food. Hong Kong Bistro only utilizes healthy cooking oil and eschews monosodium glutamate. Professional bakers and siu mei (Chinese rotisserie) masters make the bread and roast the meats.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nChee cheong fun (RMB16/bowl) and wun zai ci (RMB24/bowl) are considered two signature street snacks in Hong Kong, and both are done well here. The former consists of steamed rice rolls with lightly fried sesame seeds, black sweet sauce, sesame paste, chili paste and soybean sauce dressing on top. Just the right amount of chewiness and balancing numerous flavors, it is ideal for an afternoon break. Wun zai ci &ndash; often mistakenly believed to be shark&rsquo;s fin because it contains the word &lsquo;ci&rsquo; (fin) in its name &ndash; is a dark brown, sticky concoction of translucent fensi (glass noodles) with chicken pieces, slices of fungus and dried scallops.<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/uploads/galleries/images/hkbistro-2.jpg\" style=\"height:800px; width:533px\" /><br />\r\nThe restaurant should be particularly proud of its pork chop bun (RMB22), crispy on the outside and soft inside, with a large serving of pork that&rsquo;s big enough for two dainty ladies. Cart noodles are also a must. Widely seen in Hong Kong in the 1950s when street vendors sold it on roadsides in low-income districts, it has since become a food fad. Customers can choose the noodles, side dishes and soup that will go into their serving (RMB28 for three side dishes, RMB38 for five). Chicken wings, sausage, meat balls and pig skin are among the most popular noodle accompaniments, while fish, spicy Sichuan and curry are amongst the soup selections.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>To ease your palate from the generally intense flavors of the main meal, choose a refreshing beverage like the iced Sprite with salted lime (RMB18). Alternatively, cool off with a concoction of vanilla ice cream and mango blocks titled the Plant Ice-cream (RMB38).

Not to be confused with the British treacle tart, which differs in taste and texture, these are objects of cultural pride with roots in Canada&rsquo;s pioneering past. The first known published recipe was in a Women&rsquo;s Auxiliary cookbook in 1900 and is believed to be linked to older family recipes brought by Amish settlers for molasses shoofly pie.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The fanatical devotion to butter tarts has spawned its own tourism industry. Muskoka Lakes, Ontario hosts the annual Butter Tart Festival while Midland, Ontario has the Best Butter Tart Taste-Off. Tourists visiting North Wellington, Ontario can sign on for a day tour called the Butter Tart Trail and sample their way through bakeries and cafes in pretty Mennonite country.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Canadians have opinions about butter tart variations, such as adding nuts or raisins or coconut.

INSERT INTO `th_contents` VALUES ('1', '1', '552', '1', '<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Why is compassion important? </strong>Compassion is the ability to understand the emotional state of another person or oneself. The term is often confused with empathy, however compassion has the added element of having a desire to alleviate or reduce the suffering of another.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>Why practice compassion?</strong> Scientists have shown that when we feel compassion, our heart rate slows down, we secrete the &ldquo;bonding hormone&rdquo; oxytocin, and regions of the brain linked to empathy, caregiving, and feelings of pleasure light up, which often results in our wanting to approach and care for other people. When we are compassionate to people we are activating pleasure circuits in the brain, it makes <em>us</em> feel good!&nbsp;By tuning in to other people in a kind and loving manner we also reduce our own risk of heart disease. It also makes you more resilient to stress and strengthens the immune response. As cheesy it may sound, it also just makes the world a better place to live in!&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Therefore, starting to fully understand compassion while we&rsquo;re young is vital as we become adults. Signe Whitson, a school counselor specializing in adolescent mental health,&nbsp;writes an article&nbsp;explaining how to teach compassion to young people.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">1. Walk the Talk</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">Children may listen to your words, but more importantly, they learn from observing your actions. When you have a chance to practice a random act of compassion, do so! When you are frustrated in an interpersonal interaction, express your displeasure in words that show respect for the dignity of the person you are addressing. When you encounter a person who needs help, stop what you are doing and tend to them, even (read: especially!) if it is not particularly convenient to do so. Remember: opportunities to show compassion do not occur by appointment. Show young people that anytime is the right time to engage in acts of service and compassion for others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">2. Put the Child on the Receiving End of Compassion</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">While showing compassion to others is a top way to teach this value to a child, allowing a young person to experience compassion first-hand is even more impactful. When your child is hurt or sick, be sure to provide abundant TLCC (tender, loving, compassionate care.) It may sound obvious, but tending to a child when he is feeling down or under the weather is the best way to teach him how to show compassion to others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">3. Talk the Talk</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">Most children can learn about true compassion by seeing and feeling this trait acted out, but when parents talk explicitly about acts of compassion, they communicate its importance as a prized family value. As you watch television or movies with your child, be sure to point out instances where compassion was shown &mdash; or should have been shown! Talk about people who particularly need compassion, such as the elderly and children living in poverty.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">4. Volunteer Your Time</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">When children become actively involved in acts of showing compassion to others, they learn about this value in a very deep and enduring way. Find age-appropriate ways to introduce your child to volunteering, such as visiting a nursing home and sharing a craft activity with a resident, serving a meal at a homeless shelter, helping to organize a canned food drive, collecting coats to donate to needy children, or even participating in a charity walk for a specific cause. These activities are at once meaningful and fun, which makes them especially effective in getting kids to routinely think compassionately about the needs of others.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">5. Care for a Pet</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\"><a href=\"http://beijing.urban-family.com/article/251#pets\">Bringing a pet </a>into a family is certainly not a step to be taken lightly or impulsively, but it is worth giving serious consideration to providing your young person with the experience of caring for an animal, as a way to foster compassion. Children who care for pets learn important values such as responsibility, unconditional love, empathy, and compassion for all living things.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">6. Read All About It</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">Children&#39;s books are great for providing a window into the experiences of others. As a School Counselor, my go-to children&rsquo;s writer is Trudy Ludwig, the award-winning author of such books as My Secret Bully (my all-time favorite pick for sparking conversations with kids about bullying and relational aggression) and The Invisible Boy, a great read for inspiring empathy and compassion for young people who find themselves on the periphery of school social hierarchies. For older kids, check out biographies of famous figureheads of compassion, such as the Dalai Lama or Mother Theresa.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">7. &#39;Compassion It&#39;</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">In recent years, rubber wristbands have become a ubiquitous symbol of causes and concerns. While most of the messages are positive and inspiring, I must admit that their sheer common-ness resulted in me stopping reading the various messages on friends&rsquo; wrists. Until recently. I noticed a two-tone band that a relative was turning over and felt compelled to ask about it. It was a Compassion It band, she explained. Every morning, she puts the band on her wrist with its black side facing outward, as a personal reminder to act compassionately toward someone else. When such an act is committed each day, she turns the bracelet to its white side.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">8. Make a Wish</span></span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">Acts of life-changing compassion can be only a click away. Use the internet to introduce your child to different charitable organizations that provide compassionate assistance to others. The Make-a-Wish Foundation provides hope, strength, and joy to children with life-threatening medical conditions. While for younger kids, the site may be too heart-wrenching or scary, older kids can have a truly impactful experience of being able to provide tangible help and joy to a peer. The experience can be life-changing for both giver and receiver.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Article written by:<a href=\"http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/passive-aggressive-diaries/201407/8-ways-teach-compassion-young-people\"> Signe Whitson</a>, LSW is an author, school counselor, and national presenter on topics related to child and adolescent mental health.&nbsp; For more information, please visit <a href=\"http://signewhitson.com/\">www.signewhitson.com.</a></span></span></p>'), ('1', '1', '553', '1', '<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Congratulations!

Ask them these 3 questions each night:</span></p>\r\n\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">What is something that made you smile today?</span></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">What is something that made you cry today?</span></span></li>\r\n	<li><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">What is something that you learned today?</span></span></li>\r\n</ol>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Asking your child these questions, although very basic, is extremely beneficial for their own personal development. While going through their day you get to bond and re-connect with them. You get to see them smile and laugh all over again as they remember what they enjoyed throughout the day, you see them become more serious as they discuss something that made them sad, and watch them feel proud as they explain what they learnt.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">By asking these questions it helps children to become more emotionally in tune with themselves, it fosters their ability to articulate how they felt and why.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">It is also extremely helpful in building a positive pathway for communication. Allowing them to feel comfortable coming to you later on in their life when they find something challenging, when they need advice or simply need a shoulder to lean on.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">It also allows you as a parent to see how your children viewed their day. Your children may bring up things up you wouldn&rsquo;t expect. It helps you, as a parent, to understand your children better, and to enjoy moments that you might not have been present for.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">It also allows you to teach your children that even the negative experiences don&rsquo;t have to end negatively. Mistakes are normal, failures always lead to valuable lessons.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">I highly encourage&nbsp;incorporating these questions into your own bedtime routine with your children.

The Great Wall snakes its way through fantastic natural scenery in the mountains. Many watchtowers dot this part of the Great Wall, from which you can see the capital city on clear days. The Wall is very steep and rocky with loose stones at times, but the views it provides are spectacular.

Evelyn Waugh captured the feeling so well in this statement. It&rsquo;s so easy to fall into the trap of indulging in thoughts that act as a poison to our happiness. However, removing these unhealthy thoughts is much easier than you think. The trick is to be mindful.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I know you might be thinking - I don&rsquo;t have time to sit atop a mountain, crossed legged uttering out &ldquo;hummmm&rdquo;.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But allow me to explain: Mindfulness doesn&rsquo;t require mountains, flexible yogis and &ldquo;hummms&rdquo; - unless you want that of course. Mindfulness is a very simple technique that can be done anywhere, anytime. According to Dr. Kabat-Zinn the definition of mindfulness is &ldquo;paying attention on purpose to the present moment non judgementally.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mindfulness is the act of anchoring yourself to the current moment, the only real moment we have.&nbsp; Rather than having life pass you by, mindfulness allows us to slow down and savour each moment. It is <em>purposely</em> paying attention to the present and accepting thoughts that arise, non judgmentally.&nbsp; All that is required from you is focus and self awareness. Focusing your full attention on the present. The feeling of the sun on your back or the taste of a really delicious ice cream cone. When focusing on that present moment you may start to have a wide range thoughts arise in your mind &ldquo;I have that deadline tomorrow&hellip;I wish I was on a beach&hellip;I miss my dog&rdquo;. As you do this try not to act on these thoughts. Let them come and go and watch as they appear then disappear. Imagine having a surveillance camera on your mind, watching thoughts as they arise, not doing anything but simply noticing them. This allows you to come to the understanding that all your thoughts and feelings - good or bad - are simply transient. You are not your thoughts, and not everything you think is the truth.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp; &nbsp; Once you start practicing being mindful in everyday life you become better and better at it. Similar to working out at the gym, you work out your brain by breaking through pathways that have been created from years of multitasking, worrying over the future and ruminating over the past. When we indulge in regrets, concerns and worries it negatively impacts our mood and daily life. Sometimes leading to depression or substance abuse. Imagine being able to let go of these worries? Imagine how free you&rsquo;d feel? When we begin to understand that the present moment is the only real moment we have, we can learn to let go of all those other unnecessary thoughts. Slowly toning them down and turning them off. Mindfulness doesn&rsquo;t mean you can&rsquo;t think about the future or past, but instead when you do, you do it mindfully instead of mindlessly. Meaning we are aware that our thoughts have gone to the future so instead of feeling sour and stressed and having no idea why, we realize why we feel this way, allowing us to be more in tune with ourselves. This gives us control over our brain by handing us over the reigns. If left alone our mind will engage in an ongoing, often unproductive personal narrative which include mostly irrelevant thoughts.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Mindfulness has been around for many years, William James, considered to be the father of psychology, spoke about its benefits as far back as 1890 saying &quot;The faculty of voluntarily bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of judgement, character, and will.&nbsp; No one is compos sui (master of himself) if he have it not.&nbsp; An education which should improve this faculty would be the education par excellence.&rdquo; It is also a central practice to Buddhism. These days it seems mindfulness has come back into style because of all the advancements in the modern world demanding our attention. We spend countless hours in a virtual world, meticulously planning a perfect instagram photo that will go onto our Facebook newsfeed rather than enjoying the moment for what it is, more than how it will be perceived. Additionally, psychologists and scientists around the world have found how effective practicing mindfulness can be on our overall health, happiness and wellbeing.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;So, perhaps you&rsquo;re asking yourself: what if the present moment is terrible? How could being present be helpful? For example if you are going through a divorce, or lost your job or a close family member has died. How could being connected to that moment <em>possibly</em> be good for you? Wouldn&rsquo;t it just be better for to escape the pain? The thing is mindfulness isn&rsquo;t about choosing to connect with only the best moment. It&rsquo;s about being in the present through the good and the bad. It&rsquo;s being aware about everything happening, how you&rsquo;re feeling, and what you are thinking. If we are constantly trying to get away from the pain that life inevitably brings us, we will never fully move on. Some may turn to drugs and alcohol, or be fall into a spiral of depression. Instead of trying to get away from the moment, be there with it. Recognize that you are feeling sad, thats it ok to feel sad and recognize that pain isn&rsquo;t something you will feel forever. In order to heal, we need to accept. Acceptance is the final process in anything we face in life. Mindfulness brings us to this final step of healing. When things get tough in life we grieve, we struggle, and then we finally accept. Mindfulness is facing the situation right away, positively and constructively. Remembering that we cannot control external events in our lives, but we always have control on <em>how </em>we react.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;In a world when everything has become so fast paced, with new phones out that offer everything at the touch of our fingers, it squeezes out room for the present moment. When we learn to live in each moment it changes our relationship with life and people. It provides us with the ability to be more self-accepting rather than self-conscious. It allows us to be receptive rather than reactive and thus less emotionally triggered by external events. When arguments or problems arise we learn to take a step back and react with a more constructive response or reaction.

It does not support or discourage the use of medicines or routine medical interventions during labor and delivery. Both the mother-to-be and a supportive partner, who helps to distract the mother, are fully trained in Lamaze techniques. The techniques rely on supervised training and practice in relaxation techniques during the weeks before the birth. Expectant mothers perform exercises to strengthen the abdomen and relax the muscles around the birth canal; this preparation helps to reduce the strain of pushing during delivery. Another exercise is the rehearsal of deep chest breathing and rapid, shallow breathing during periods of maximum strain; this technique helps to reduce uterine tension. Lamaze training also includes instruction in the processes of labor and delivery.<br />\r\n<span style=\"color:rgb(0, 128, 128)\">Lamaze classes are conducted at most major hospitals in the PRD.

Although gluten-free diets are one of the most popular food trends, there is no benefit to going gluten-free if it is not medically warranted. In fact most people that decide to become gluten free are doing so at the the expense of their health. Whole grains, which contain gluten, are a good source of fiber, vitamins and minerals. Gluten-free products are often made with refined grains, and are low in nutrients. If you embrace such a diet, you may end up eating a lot of foods that are stripped of nutrients. Studies have shown that gluten-free diets can be deficient in fiber, iron, folate, niacin, thiamine, calcium, vitamin B12, phosphorus and zinc. Of course you can eat a healthy diet without gluten, but you have to be very knowledgeable, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdJFE1sp4Fw\">and most people aren&rsquo;t</a>.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">If much of your diet comes from baked goods and large portions of wheat-based foods (like pasta or bread), then you will probably lose weight if you cut out gluten. But following a gluten-free diet doesn&#39;t necessarily guarantee a slimmer waistline. Many gluten-free products are loaded with more sugar and fat than their gluten-filled counterparts. Don&rsquo;t be fooled, a gluten-free cupcake is not healthier than a cupcake with gluten.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>bottom line</strong>: Gluten isn&rsquo;t the enemy <em>unless </em>you have been diagnosed with celiac disease. If you don&#39;t have celiac disease, a wheat allergy or a gluten sensitivity, you&#39;re unlikely to benefit from a gluten-free diet. However, if you decide you want to go gluten free anyway, then do it the right way. Replace wheat with a healthy, naturally gluten-free grain, such as quinoa or buckwheat. Balance the diet with lots of fruits and vegetables, eat more lean meat and dairy products such as yogurt.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '575', '1', '<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140722160059.jpg\" style=\"height:349px; width:400px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">What is a volcano?&nbsp;</span></strong></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">A volcano is a mountain that opens downward to a pool of molten rock below the surface of the earth. When pressure builds up, eruptions occur. Gases and rock shoot up through the opening and spill over or fill the air with lava fragments. Eruptions can cause lateral blasts, lava flows, hot ash flows, mudslides, avalanches, falling ash and floods. Volcano eruptions have been known to knock down entire forests. An erupting volcano can trigger tsunamis, flash floods, earthquakes, mudflows and rockfalls.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>How do they form?&nbsp;</strong></span></span><br />\r\n<span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">Volcanoes are formed when magma from within the Earth&#39;s upper mantle works its way to the surface.

Instead this &ldquo;selfie&rdquo; exhibit is meant to reveal the psychosocial reasons behind these ever so common self-photographs.&nbsp;</span></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Who would&rsquo;ve thought there could be any depth to the vacuous idea of a selfie? Just the term conjures images of self-absorbed celebrities pouting for their iPhone in 35 different angles. Photographer Liu Zheng has, for the past 6 months, been inviting people to submit their &lsquo;selfies&rsquo; to him (in case you&rsquo;ve been living under a rock, a selfie is a self-taken photograph usually on a cell phone or a digicam used commonly by young people). He then chose the most interesting and diverse selfies, usually ones involving nudity.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">From the photos presented, we see that most participants are young people who have diverse interests and come from a wide variety of backgrounds. There are also couples, pregnant women, gay men, and breast-feeding mothers. In the process of photographing themselves and often their naked bodies, they reveal their innermost private sensual self, sharing it freely with the public.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">A selfie enables people to express themselves in many ways, to feel reaffirmed and to prove their uniqueness in the world. A seemingly simple selfie contains a wide variety of complicated motives and deep psychosocial elements including - but not limited to - narcissism, exhibitionism and voyeurism.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">We sit down with Liu Zheng and ask him what his motives are behind his series &ldquo;selfies&rdquo;. To Zheng, a selfie is far more than just narcissism. It reveals a persons relationship with life, their living conditions and how they interact with their world. It is where photography combines self-expression and self discovery, a selfie is a way to feel connected to a world that is becoming more and more disconnected.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">As a photographer, Liu Zheng, appears rather disengaged with his selfie series. We ask if he feels China is pulling further away from a collectivist society and instead into a more individualized, narcissistic one through the use of selfies. He simply shrugs his shoulders, &ldquo;I never really thought about that. I just find selfies interesting. I&rsquo;m just a platform for people to&hellip; perform.&rdquo;&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">According Liu Zheng, &ldquo;a selfie has always been around. Before smart phones, an artist would paint or draw themselves. A selfie is just a newer form of self-expression that has simply evolved to fit this generation.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140804154715.jpg\" style=\"height:507px; width:400px\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><strong>Where</strong>:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/P%C3%A9kin+Fine+Arts/@39.9024,116.427,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xc74335b15dd3d6c5\">P&eacute;kin Fine Arts </a>,&nbsp;241 Caochangdi, Cui Ge Zhuang<br />\r\n<strong>When</strong>: Everyday until&nbsp;September 15th.<br />\r\n<strong>Time:</strong> 10am-6pm.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '594', '2', '<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">The Schoolhouse at Mutianyu Great Wall will be holding its first Farmer&#39;s Market at the Orchard Plaza in Tianxianyu Village from 11:00am - 3:00pm.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Villagers from the area will be providing organic food from their own farms, selling everything different types of vegetables, fruits and even&nbsp;homemade crafts.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">There is no charge to visitors, nor is there a charge to set up a vendor stand.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">As this is their first time running a market they are welcome to suggestions and help.

Expats are also importing their love of canines into the Middle Kingdom and making the wise choice to expand the family unit with a new, loyal member. Nevertheless, there are many things to consider when keeping the barkiest member of the crew healthy and happy. Here are some top tips. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Living arrangements</strong> - China is rich in apartments but not so in backyards. For all breeds, it&rsquo;s important that they have their own designated space in the home that&rsquo;s shaded. Exercise, of course, is absolutely crucial. Taking the dog out at least twice a day is a must &ndash; and not just for a pee and a poo. Apartment dogs have little room to roam; they need to be walked and socialize with other dogs via the wondrous canine art of butt-sniffing. Remember to feed the dog after exercise, not before, so as to more precisely mirror nature&rsquo;s way &ndash; hunt, eat, chill. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Breeds</strong> - Toy breeds are best-suited for apartments, including poodles, which don&rsquo;t shed. Shih Tzu&#39;s are also a good choice for families with children, as they have a sweet temperament and a super-cute under-bite. The calmer varieties of larger dogs such as greyhounds are also solid, but it&rsquo;s best to avoid working dogs because they get frisky and may vent their frustrations by destroying stuff, doing a dump behind the couch or occasioning other unwelcome behaviors. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Keeping your dog clean</strong>- This is a must and fortunately, China has spawned a thriving pet shop industry that empowers lazy owners to get their dogs showered cheaply. Less known is the importance of keeping canine chompers clean. Although dogs (other than Pekinese) are not known for their vanity, plaque builds up, nails get long, and coats become matted and sometimes graced with other dogs&rsquo; turds because dogs roll in poo to mask their scent. Teeth cleaning, nail clipping, bathing and coat brushing should form a regular part of canine grooming. Most decent pet shops will either sell the required implements or offer grooming services to keep them free of ticks and such like. Contrary to popular</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"> belief, it&rsquo;s not necessary to shave longhaired dogs to mitigate the effects of China&rsquo;s brutal summers. According to Nis Lorentzen from the British-run vet clinic Doctors Beck and Stone, &ldquo;Dogs don&rsquo;t keep cool through skin perspiration like humans. They cool down by panting.&rdquo; However, he adds, &ldquo;It is very important to keep dogs from cooler climates cool and hydrated during summer. Outdoor exercise in the sun should be limited in duration, and the dog should have access to fresh water and air-conditioning at all times.&rdquo; </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Health matters -</strong> Vaccinations that are taken for granted in the West are not available for dogs in China, but generally multivaccinations that include distemper and Parvo virus and rabies shots are available &ndash; a rabies shot is in fact a legal requirement. In the PRD, it&rsquo;s also important to protect dogs against heartworm with medication. Veterinary practice and boarding services are still at a lower standard than in the West. Family holidays that sadly don&rsquo;t or can&rsquo;t include the dog require that he or she is housed in a safe and clean environment, walked at least twice daily, fed well and vaccinated against kennel cough. Unfortunately, some Chinese pet shops and clinics have been known to mistreat or neglect animals, so homework needs to be done, research conducted and anecdotal recommendations sought if owners are unable to find a Western-run clinic. </span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:14px\"><strong>Registration</strong> - It is also a legal requirement that dogs are registered with the local police each year. To ensure pets are not confiscated or worse, Lorentzen warns, &rdquo;Make sure your dog is registered and up to date with vaccinations. Carry copies of these documents with the receipts when you take your dog out for a walk.&rdquo; Additionally, most complaints regarding dogs concern barking, so early attention to training out this behavior will avoid problems with the neighbors and apartment admin. Dognapping is an ever- present threat plaguing every country, including China &ndash; preferably keep dogs on a leash when walking them, drop some dog bling with a name tag and contact number and deploy ID chipping if possible. Note the PRD&rsquo;s caveat emptor about dog volume:<br />\r\nGuangzhou has enacted a law restricting dog ownership to one; Shenzhen law bans &ldquo;aggressive dogs&rdquo; (which in fact should mean inept owners), and states in passionate legalese: &ldquo;Keeping two or more dogs<br />\r\nshall be allowed only if it is in accordance with the related bylaws of a community or</span><span style=\"font-size:14px\"> a residential quarter where the dog owner lives; the certificate of approval from a resident committee or a proprietor committee shall be presented for registration of such dog keeping.&rdquo; Finally, dogs should preferably be neutered. Though not a legal requirement, it does reduce spraying and aggression in male dogs, lowers incidents of leg-lovin&rsquo;, and can increase longevity by reducing the chance of some dog cancers. Above all, remember there&rsquo;s no such thing as a bad dog, only a bad owner. We say &ldquo;woof&rdquo; to that!</span><br />\r\n&nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '609', '2', '<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\">Who needs Paris when you can spend the afternoon at the Eiffel Tower in Beijing?</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140807164647.jpg\" style=\"height:720px; width:581px\" /></span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">Sounds strange, but it exists.&nbsp;<br />\r\nBeijing has it&rsquo;s very own <a href=\"https://www.google.com/maps/place/World+Park/@39.810622,116.287868,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x16101d41e782c09f\">&ldquo;World Park&rdquo;</a>, a miniature park containing the world&rsquo;s most famous monuments and attractions, with 109 world-famous attractions from 40 different countries.

You sit in a little cart that pulls you along through a dark room with &lsquo;scary&rsquo; baby seals jumping out at you and some eerie music playing with flash lights on small stuffed animals covered in dust. It sort of looks like a ride they decided to keep because they thought, &ldquo;ehhh, why not?&rdquo; it ends with a dinosaur-looking creature thrashing his head into your cart. Although it&rsquo;s not a highlight, children will find it amusing.&nbsp;</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">They also have golf carts that are 100RMB to rent for one hour. Now these are well worth it since it probably takes around 4 hours to trek through the whole park. Also, golf carts are always fun.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\">The park literally has everything you can think of, and is an easy getaway to take children on the weekend. It only about took about an hour car ride from downtown.</span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140807164747.jpg\" style=\"height:270px; width:510px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140807165707.jpg\" style=\"height:561px; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140807170150.jpg\" style=\"height:373px; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140807171513.jpg\" style=\"height:360px; width:480px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px\"><strong>Address:</strong> No.158 Feng Bao Rd.

What it must be like to be so sure of one&#39;s identity - of one&#39;s surroundings, one&#39;s neighbours, one&#39;s place in the world.&nbsp; To not wander with knowing yet without intending; to be firmly implanted on this earth, with roots and pure, uncomplicated histories; to be without the hyphenated labels dotting my official documents, my survey answers, my journal entries - my very self.&nbsp; To explain, I must give you my life trajectory.&nbsp; In as few words as possible and after years of refinement, here it is: I was born in the USA, moved as a babe to Taiwan until age 8, where I spent two years in Boston then left for Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp; I have since spent three months in Uganda and two months backpacking in Europe.&nbsp; Now I live in Beijing and am poised to keep up my international style.&nbsp; I agree - it is an explanation much longer than something like &quot;I was born and raised on a Swedish farm.&quot;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">So by virtue of having three nationalities, I am very much a &#39;third culture kid&#39;.&nbsp;

There are difficulties, practical and philosophical, in this way of life.&nbsp; As a lover of the art of writing, there have been more than a few words devoted to my existential crises.&nbsp; Yet the differences across&nbsp; cultures serve to highlight the sameness.&nbsp; From across the Taiwan Strait to Beijing, from the six hour drive of Vancouver to Eugene, from the hundreds of miles spanning Kampala and London - I&#39;ve seen the same themes.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Politics is full of corruption; health is paramount (pollution, or water scarcity, or even pine beetles endangering the health of BC forests); job security is on everyone&#39;s minds; there is a perverse fascination with celebrities and pop culture.&nbsp; People laugh everywhere and are rude everywhere.&nbsp; In other words, we serve the same purposes on a dizzying array of platters.&nbsp; Rules about holding hands, about greetings and proper eye contact, about titles and hierarchies, about customs and beliefs.&nbsp; Even as I sit now, alone in my room typing with my short determined fingers, I&#39;m sure there are a thousand social conventions governing my behaviour.&nbsp; I&#39;ve tried hard to understand why sometimes it&#39;s okay for me to be outgoing, while other times it&#39;s considered extremely unpleasant.&nbsp; Or why one joke works one place but not another; why people say one thing but mean something else; the layers of implication under my roommates comments about using a blanket if I sleep with air conditioning.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">It&#39;s a constant puzzle I doubt I&#39;ll ever solve.&nbsp; But most of us manoeuver these pieces unconsciously - it is only those afflicted with a mind that thinks too much who have to ponder on these issues.&nbsp; But I am glad for it.&nbsp; I do not know what else I would be writing, if I were that fabled farm boy who knew nothing else.&nbsp; I may crave his deep understanding, his certain embeddedness and his matter-of-fact movements - for I&#39;ll never move about my homes like that.&nbsp; But I will write of my admiration, respect and appreciation of my experiences across cultures.&nbsp; I know though, that even if I were him, in another universe: I&#39;d still be writing, to tell you what it&#39;s like.&nbsp; And perhaps that means we wouldn&#39;t be so different after all.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140811172729.jpg\" style=\"height:533px;

They called it Shameen Island, though it is more commonly known today as Shamian Island. In 1888, the Banque de I&rsquo;Indochine settled down at 16-18 Shameen Nan Lu to much fanfare, issuing notes and representing international trade between France and China.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Fast-forward to 2014 and the three-story, 2,500-square-meter heritage estate is now a striking gray-hued art deco space that triples up as a restaurant, meeting venue and all-suite hotel. You can almost smell the wealth as you walk in, with its cash registers housed behind solid steel bars, suspended chandeliers, a musty, wooden redolence that speaks volumes about the building&rsquo;s rich past and original fireplaces that have retained an ageless, graceful character. But Shameen 1618 is more than just that. &nbsp;<br />\r\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/uploads/galleries/images/shameen-1618-2.jpg\" style=\"height:533px; margin-bottom:5px; margin-top:5px; width:800px\" /><br />\r\nIt&rsquo;s eclectic. It&rsquo;s eccentric. It&rsquo;s eerie. It&rsquo;s almost perplexing and little seems to match at first, yet somehow, just somehow, it all works in harmony. It&rsquo;s Salvador Dali meets Michelangelo, Philippe Stark meets Dorothy Draper, Palace of Versailles meets Hunyad Castle and rococo meets renaissance. As if that weren&rsquo;t enough, it cost the four owners a cool RMB15 million to embellish. Every inch of Shameen 1618 is a mystery waiting to be discovered, especially the second floor, where eight private rooms beckon for some surreptitious, almost cult-like good times.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Styled after countries and, interestingly enough, religions, the rooms &ndash; available for just about any purpose &ndash; exude an old-fashioned yet hip ode to their namesakes, with frescoed doors signifying hints of patriotic boldness and mischief, spiced up with uncommon but refreshing color contrasts. The French room is adorned with velveteen curtains, vintage, one-off pieces, nouveau tableware and sky-accented walls. The Japanese room features a sunken dining table while the Zoroastrianism chamber is a Persian fantasy, swanky and plush, a throwback to the days when the China Canton Anjuman ruled its diaspora in the early 1830s.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The America, Germany, Russia, Holland and China spaces follow suit, outfitted as though affluent nomads ran amuck picking imported tile art, knick-knacks and curios to fill every corner.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The third floor is meant for those with a tendency to over-indulge on their wide selection of vino and liquors. Four majestic rooms with balconies and open-air patios offer up a lair complete with a sauna and top-notch mod cons, at a cost ranging from RMB1,900 to 2,900 a night.

Not just any food, but hawker food, the food of the street; the soul of its nations. Forget your fancy hotel fare or those Michelin stars. Hawker food is the real deal. You eat with your hands and lick your fingers when it&rsquo;s all done. You are happy to wait over an hour for one exquisite dish and sigh deeply when the plate is empty.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Take Singapore, for example. More than 80 percent of the local population eats at least one meal a day at its 40,000 licensed hawker stalls, where you&rsquo;ll find some of the best, most authentic and most inexpensive dishes in variations that will astound you, especially when you consider the ethnic amalgam of Chinese, Indian and Malay. In countries like Thailand and Indonesia, that number is even greater.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>My Old Place, tucked away in the basement of Grandview Mall, is an Asian hawker-food celebration and sensation, encouraging diners to deepen their discovery of Singapore, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia by immersing themselves in their gastronomic treasures. The decor is food-court reminiscent with colorful touches of retro chic and palms, but who cares about the ambiance when your taste buds are salivating with anticipation?</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One of those seminal foods that Singaporeans distinctly remember from their childhood, the Hainanese chicken rice (RMB68/118) features silky slices of tender chicken on a bed of crunchy cucumbers, fragrant garlic and ginger rice, accompanied by soup and dipping sauces.

Cooked with shrimp, tofu, crisp peanuts and spring onions, it&rsquo;s as if a Thai street vendor has just whipped it to perfection over a steaming wok. The chicken satay (RMB48) is generous chunks of grilled meat, golden, with a hint of palm sugar and served with an appetizing peanut sauce.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Imported ingredients, age-old family recipes and, most importantly, chefs that hail from their respective countries cook up a bone fide Asian storm.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s not all about stuffing your stomach, though, strange as that may seem when you are chowing down on an authentically prepared chili crab (RMB188).

A hefty 450 books appear on stage, contorted to create various objects from a flock of birds to a city.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;There is also a tango with the books,&rdquo; says co-director Grace Chapman. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s lovely to hear the gasps from the audience when we transform a pile of books into a plane or a spiral staircase on stage. These combined with multimedia result in really striking visuals.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Describing the show as &ldquo;a beautiful musing on our relationships with books and the impact they have throughout our lives,&rdquo; Chapman promises the show will appeal to more than literary lovers and fiction fanatics.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>%Borges and I explores the life and work of Argentinean writer Jorge Luis Borges, a pioneer of the magical realism that shaped 20th-century Latin American literature, popularized by Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez&rsquo;s <em>One Hundred Years of Solitude</em>. It also tells the story of a young couple called Nick and Sophie who meet each other at a book group and fall in love.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;As the piece progresses, we learn that both Borges and Sophie will lose their sight. Despite the characters being in different centuries and countries, they share a love of literature and words.

It&rsquo;s not all doom and gloom, however; the mood of the play oscillates between &ldquo;moments of laughter and silliness as well as moments of real sadness and reflection.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Its debut at the 2009 Edinburgh Fringe Festival resulted in sold-out shows and a coveted Total Theatre nomination for Best Emerging Company. Instant validation for a group that was officially founded two years earlier, but whose members first worked together as 14-year-olds attending school in Oxford.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;At the time it was a hobby and a way to spend our summer holidays,&rdquo; reflects Chapman, who also serves as Idle Motion&rsquo;s producer and company manager.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;From touring this show around the world, we&rsquo;ve come to realize that this play appeals to so many different types of people on account of its visual nature and inventive staging. We didn&rsquo;t realize this when we first made it but it explores universal themes that appeal to a wide audience and we&rsquo;re thrilled to do this.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The company has come a long way since Borges and I&rsquo;s initial success. They&rsquo;ve made three other shows that toured both nationally and internationally, including <em>The Vanishing Horizon</em> &ndash; a tribute to female aviation pioneers like Amelia Earhart that thrilled crowds in Beijing and Shanghai last year. They&rsquo;re currently creating their sixth show, <em>Shooting with Light</em>, and plan to bring another production, <em>This is All You Need to Know</em>, to China in late October.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;When we first made<em> Borges and </em>I, we never dreamt that it would come to China,&rdquo; Chapman says. &ldquo;Whenever we think about it, we can&rsquo;t quite believe it.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The play&rsquo;s sustained popularity since its knock-out debut is testament to its artistic grandeur; however, what you see on stage today is an entirely different specimen to the original, which continues to metamorphose from performance to performance.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&ldquo;Our shows are constantly evolving,&rdquo; says Chapman. &ldquo;Every performance we will try something new, whether it&rsquo;s saying a line differently or tightening up a scene change.&rdquo;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><em>// August 29-31, 8pm, RMB80-280.

The waterfall effect releases tension and improves blood circulation.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nMoving to the sunken waterbed, a Green Coffee body wrap is applied. Research has shown that caffeine is an effective element in combating cellulite. Combined with natural enzymes, the wrap reduces water retention and the appearance of skin dimpling. The body is cocooned in three layers and the bed lowered, giving the feeling of being set afloat on a placid sea. A scalp massage is given while the warmth increases alongside the penetration rates of the wrap. All this water exposure could leave the skin feeling dry, but a rich moisturizing balm is applied during an anti-stress massage to ensure balance is restored.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTo complete the experience, guests can later enjoy the extensive spa and fitness facilities, which occupy an entire floor of the hotel.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>// RMB1,188 for 90 minutes.

The grogginess I felt when I first arrived instantly replaced by energy and excitement. I am on a sailboat with 2 friends and an instructor. The boat quickly picks up speed by a burst of wind and suddenly begins to tip, we all instinctively counteract our inevitable capsize by forcibly shifting our weight to the opposite side of the boat, essentially we are leaning off the edge. Thankfully the boat evens out and we all start laughing infectiously, &ldquo;three minutes in and we almost capsized, great start guys!&rdquo; my friend Kat sarcastically yells out through a smile. Although the possibility of tipping may be a fun adrenaline rush when you&rsquo;re close to shore, I can&rsquo;t imagine the terror of sailing in the deep waters, miles away from land and being that close to capsizing - fending for yourself in the ocean. Especially if those waters are home to sharks. Ahead of us, we notice another sailboat on the verge of keeling over, we all start howling at them in vicarious anxiety of their inevitable tip. Evidently the riders on the boat were unaware that counterweighting the boat will help to stop capsizing, the boat quickly goes over.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140815215739.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; opacity:0.9; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp; &nbsp; Sailing. Not an activity commonly associated with the landlocked city of Beijing. Most of my Chinese friends can barely swim let alone sail. When I think about sailing, I immediately think of a luxury sport, a sport cut out only for the pros - the overly rich pros at that. A sailor in my mind evokes an image of young attractive men, men who wear polo shirts, smoke cigars, laugh obnoxiously and overdo it on the cologne. Men who are confident, charismatic and filthy rich. The <a href=\"http://www.beijingsailing.com/index_en.htm\">Beijing Sailing Club </a>is much different than these pre-existing notions of cologne drenched, popped collared lads - it is an affordable activity, and surprisingly convenient to get to. Located in Nandaihe, on the gulf of Bohai, and only a two hour train ride from Beijing Train Station. From the Bedaihe train station the Sailing Club is only 20 minutes away in Nandaihe, in the south. By the time we reach the entrance of Azure Beach Hua Mao it&rsquo;s the early afternoon and already sweltering. We stop to take a look at a large, 5 foot transformer-like yellow robot. We take our necessary robot-posed photos and carry on to the water, passing by billboards with an image of a perfect, empty beach with pure white sands, trimmed with turquoise blue waters and a woman wearing an oversized straw hat swinging on a hammock, &ldquo;Azure Beach Hua Mao, Nandaihe&rdquo; it reads. <em>Right&hellip;</em> I think to myself. As most of us know, beaches in China tend to be notorious for being overpopulated and dirty. In reality this beach, to my surprise, is not brimming with thousands of Chinese tourists. In fact, it&rsquo;s nearly empty with only the occasional Chinese tourist sitting under any crevice of shade they can muster, decked out in spandex bodysuits, a hat, and faces painted white from thick layers of sunscreen. Crystal blue water it is not, a bit more of a murky, greenish hue, but it is very clean and well maintained. No visible garbage in sight, just seaweed. The bathrooms are also surprisingly well-kept and even have clean showers with lockers. Along the beach there is a beautiful long stretch of a boardwalk as well as a pier heading out to the water. The people of Nandiahe are very friendly, they find my lack of Chinese endearing rather than annoying. They smile more and seem more relaxed. Beach life I suppose. The area, much like most of China, is in the midst of anticipating a boom. Big &ldquo;all inclusive&rdquo; style resorts are in mid-construction, and there&rsquo;s even a squeaky clean golf course. Reminds me of a Florida beach retirement area, except the Chinese version.</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140815215701.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; opacity:0.9; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp; &nbsp; The Beijing Sailing Center has been open since 2006 and is the first accredited sailing school in China. Starting with only 2 boats, originally in Qinhuandao and moving to Nandaihe, the Sailing Center now has a fleet of 34 sailboats. The founder, Rick Pointon, is a British man with many years of sailing under his belt, &ldquo;the thing about sailing is, it&rsquo;s easy to learn but takes years to master&rdquo; he says. I ask him if he&rsquo;s close to mastering it yet, &ldquo;no, definitely not!&rdquo; he tells me laughing. Although I didn&rsquo;t see him sail, I&rsquo;m sure he&rsquo;s pretty close. He casually tells me he has sailed around the world a few times. Pointon came here in 2006 and decided to open his very own sailing company. &ldquo;I really enjoy how sailing is the kind of sport that evenly incorporates brains and brawns&rdquo;. Sailing is about angling the boat in a certain way to maximize the wind&rsquo;s pull, it involves thinking and planning the next move. I take a boat out to meet two other instructors who are sitting on a small raft keeping track of the members race taking place. I ask them what they do when the winter comes since the sailing club shuts down, &ldquo;I chase the summer&rdquo; says Nathan with a big smile, exposing a mouth of full of bright white teeth, a stark contrast to his bronzed skin from endless days in the sun. He&rsquo;s from England and is only 19 years old. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a fan of winter so I follow the summers, I taught sailing in New Zealand last year and I think this winter I&rsquo;m going to try to go to Australia&rdquo;. Sounds like a dream to me I think, I too hate the cold. Callum, a 21 year old with hair so bleached from the sun its turned bright yellow, tells me he returns to England to find work and heads back to the sailing club come summertime. Both guys speak very little Chinese, I wonder how it works when teaching to Chinese people who speak little English. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s very challenging&rdquo; both of them turn to me with serious expressions. &ldquo;I have to think of the most simplest way to explain something then simplify it another four times to explain it. It&rsquo;s made me a much better teacher. Now when I go back to England or teach in English speaking countries, it&rsquo;s a total breeze&rdquo; says Nathan with a smirk, Callum nods his head in agreement. &ldquo;It makes me more patient, for sure.&rdquo;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140815215830.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; opacity:0.9; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp; &nbsp; Programs range depending on what you are looking for. Each program is two-days long. First there is the bronze course for those who have never sailed before. By the end of this course, sailors will be able to sail a boat in all possible directions under supervision and in light conditions. The course teaches the basic knowledge required to sail. Next is the Silver course which aims to get it&rsquo;s students sailing independently, with the minimum requirement being the Bronze course. Following that are the 5x gold level courses: Go Independent, Go Cruising, Go Kiting Go Racing and Go Fast. Each of these gold level courses focus on a specific skill. If you are unsure whether you want to commit to a two day course you can try a one hour &ldquo;Sailing Experience&rdquo; with one of their skilled instructors and then decide if you want to do a full course. Additionally, they have many sailing camp programs for children and youth. Programs range from 5, 7 to 12 day camps and offer children a chance to learn about leadership, teamwork and improve their inter-personal relationship skills.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140815215420.jpg\" style=\"height:375px; opacity:0.9; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">&nbsp; &nbsp; After a day of sailing and lounging on the beach, my friends and I make our way to a BBQ dinner taking place on the beach. The dinner is prepared by a mix of different events from the Beijing Sailing Club, to different real estate companies. The beach may not be crowded in the day but by 6:00pm sharp the people are out in groups and everyone is swimming or lounging on the beach. We sit patiently awaiting dinner, looking out at the waves through breaks in the crowds of people staring at us. Lots of staring matches and the occasional not-so-discreet photo taken of us while we are in mid sneeze. It&rsquo;s dark by the time we finish dinner. Slow, classical music fills the air, and we hear a man with a microphone yell out with a thick Chinese accent &ldquo;<em>join the party with us in the fire!</em>&rdquo; Everyone at the dinner, almost in-sync, leaves the dinner table and begin to run full-force behind me. I turn around and notice two massive tipis in the distance that have erupted in fire. Everyone starts holding hands and dancing along the fire. It reminds me of some kind of strange witchcraft, voodoo performance so I decide to join in on the weirdness. Running. Because it seems like I should. By the time I get closer the tipis have dramatically toppled over leaving the remnants of two perfect bonfires. I am instantly brought back to lazy summers at a cottage in Canada, roasting marshmallows by the fire, mesmerized by the flames. Within a few minutes, I look up and notice the beach is almost completely empty, it&rsquo;s just my friends and I, slightly buzzed from beer and wine and wondering how a party could go from BBQ dinners, to witchcraft lighting tipis to immediate bedtime. We end up walking down the pier sitting at the edge, feet dangling off, exchanging stories, laughing and watching fleets of pirate ship-looking boats in the distance. Presumably trying to find scraps of fish or anything else edible to sell or consume. We finally end up making our way back to the beach where our tents await for us to assemble them. If you plan on setting up camp on the beach, it&rsquo;s always a smart idea to set the tents up <em>before</em> it gets dark. Nevertheless, we somehow managed to assembled our tents and crawled in for a blissful snooze.&nbsp;</span></span></p>\r\n\r\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/uploads/galleries/images/20140816021953.jpg\" style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif; font-size:16px; height:375px; opacity:0.9; width:500px\" /></p>\r\n\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><span style=\"font-family:tahoma,geneva,sans-serif\">Overall a great experience. One of the perks of living in China is the convenience of traveling by train throughout the country. It&rsquo;s inexpensive, comfortable and enjoyable. Train rides have always been my most preferred method of travel, especially when you get a window seat, head resting on the window, ipod fully charged and plugged in, it really doesn&rsquo;t get much better than that. I can easily spend hours watching the world go by, listening to music and envisioning the adventures to come. Although Azure beach may not have crystal blue waters and pure white sand, it has its own charm. Its laid back and calm, its not busy, the facilities are clean and so is the ocean. It&rsquo;s a an easy getaway with friends on a weekend and a perfect short summer holiday.

With her homely shape and wrinkleless face, this London-born Japanese bobtail cat is still one of the most beloved fictional characters around the world, liked by both children and grown-ups alike &ndash; particularly in Asia.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/uploads/galleries/images/hello-kitty-2.jpg\" style=\"float:left; height:50%; margin:5px; width:50%\" />The feminine feline finally put down roots in Guangzhou a few months ago, as the first <a href=\"http://listings.thatsmags.com/guangzhou/venue/10256\" target=\"_blank\">Hello Kitty-themed cafe</a> opened in the Mall of the World. If cute could be personified, it would appear as Hello Kitty, and the decor reflects that with its clean whites and bright pinks.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>One step inside and you will find yourself entering a fairytale garden of oddities: tables of every shape; waitresses dressed in maid costumes; and three large models of the cuddly cat herself. Naturally, it&rsquo;s a magnet for kids, who run around shrieking in wild abandon, while older patrons snap away eagerly on camera phones. Incongruously, rock music plays in the background.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Originally, Hello Kitty was portrayed as a kind-hearted kitten who was good at baking cookies and loved collecting cutesy things. In keeping with its origins, the cafe sells deserts, soft drinks and accessories with Hello Kitty logos. But has it also inherited the cat&rsquo;s culinary ability? We decided to figure that out ourselves by trying some of the place&rsquo;s most popular desserts through the automatic, easy-to-use ordering system.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"http://online.thatsmags.com/uploads/galleries/images/hello-kitty-3.jpg\" style=\"float:right; height:50%; margin:5px; width:50%\" />Coated by a thick layer of white chocolate, the heart-shaped Snow Kiss Mousse (RMB38) is a sponge cake filled with chocolate mousse. The softness of the cake, the airy texture of the mousse and the smoothness of the chocolate all make this dessert a must-try. If you are ambivalent about sweetness, order the raspberry mousse (RMB38), which is served in the shape of Hello Kitty&rsquo;s head and covered by a layer of fresh raspberries, adding a bit of sour bite.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>We don&rsquo;t think anyone can withstand the temptation to try the green tea and strawberry cake (RMB58), a colorful dessert consisting of fresh red strawberries, white whipped cream and yellow custard sandwiched between two pieces of green bread. When the rainbow hues are so delightful, who cares that it tastes a bit plain? Mixing fresh mango blocks, smashed mango paste and jelly together, the mango jelly beverage (RMB38) is a pleasing treat for the simmering heat.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Sweeping away the saccharine (at least in terms of flavor), the house latte (RMB38) is slightly watery and will not impress die-hard caffeine lovers. Like so much of the cafe, however, its appeal is all in the presentation. On the coffee surface a miniature Hello Kitty has been imprinted on the foam, Cupid&rsquo;s bow raised, ready to make fans of the uber-adorable fall in love. &nbsp;</p>'), ('1', '1', '638', '2', '<div class=\"arcbody\">\r\n<p>On September 7, 1822, Pedro I declared Brazil an independent country, freeing it from its Portuguese colonial rulers.

Brown and fuzzy on the outside, green and zesty on the inside, with a circle of tiny black seeds, it is a festival of flavor for adventurous fruit lovers.</div>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The kiwifruit, currently in season, is frequently mistaken as being an export from New Zealand. In fact, it originates in the mountains and hills of South China. Yes, China. Known as the Chinese gooseberry, it was first introduced to New Zealand in 1904 by a school headmistress named Mary Isabel Fraser, who brought the prized seeds across the seas. It was a novelty crop until 1959, when its name was changed to kiwifruit, after New Zealand&rsquo;s national bird, the kiwi &ndash; itself small, brown and furry. Today, kiwifruit are New Zealand&rsquo;s highest-earning horticultural crop and a marketing success story.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Chefs love using the kiwifruit because it&rsquo;s different, colorful and &ndash; when used correctly &ndash; adds a unique sweet and tangy touch to just about anything. Western Kitchen Pastry Chef Anita from the Chimelong Hotel Guangzhou likes to pair it with the Italian staple of panna cotta for a deliciously light and creamy treat. This simple recipe will bring joy and smiles to the whole family, and makes for a perfect late autumn dessert.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>Ingredients (serves six):</strong><br />\r\n6 egg yolks<br />\r\n100g granulated sugar<br />\r\n200g whipping cream<br />\r\n85ml Cointreau<br />\r\n120g kiwifruit, diced</p>\r\n\r\n<p><br />\r\n<strong>Preparation:</strong><br />\r\n1) Put the six egg yolks into an electric mixer.

Add most of the diced kiwifruit, but set aside a small amount for later.&nbsp;<br />\r\n3) Place the mixture in a tall glass and put it in the fridge for about two hours till it sets.<br />\r\n4) Remove and top with leftover diced kiwifruit.

And the Chinese have a proverb: if a man cheats the earth, the earth will cheat man.&rdquo; This excerpt is from a speech by President Bush at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, where world leaders trumpeted their promises for sustainable development planning.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAs the world weighed in with their impressions, Television Trust for the Environment (TVE) commissioned London-born documentary-maker Bruno Sorrentino to spearhead a groundbreaking, pioneering documentary project: to film 12 babies for the next 20 years, all born in 1992, from China, Brazil, India, Kenya, Latvia, Papua New Guinea, South Africa, UK and USA.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nTwo decades later, the children are on the threshold of adulthood, coinciding with the release of the documentaries at the 2012 Rio Earth Summit. The stories offer a startling portrait of the range of human experience and global change. Some speak of unembellished despair and tragedy. Two of the 12 children are dead.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd then there&rsquo;s Kay Kay, the girl from Guangzhou. Perhaps the most positive and emblematic one of all, her tale mirrors China&rsquo;s sweeping social and economic transformation and the rise of a powerful new &ndash; and largely urban &ndash; middle class. Sorrentino, who describes Guangzhou as a &ldquo;construction site&rdquo; in 1992, now declares that it&rsquo;s &ldquo;one of the most agreeable, livable cities. I&rsquo;m amazed at the rapid rate of modernization. It&rsquo;s changed beyond recognition. But as always, I am cautiously optimistic. I question whether real change has been made, or if they have simply exported pollution from the city to countryside.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nHailing from a family that was essentially a model of communist China in 1992, the sweet and witty university-bound Kay Kay appears to have a profound sense of self, amidst all the structural and commercial transformation surrounding her. &ldquo;She is who she is,&quot; says Sorrentino. &quot;She&rsquo;s aware of the sacrifices her parents have made for her. And like all girls her age, she wants a beautiful life but she&rsquo;s not living in an illusion. She knows how hard she has to work for it.&rdquo;<br />\r\n<br />\r\nSorrentino and TVE are currently planning to turn Kay Kay&rsquo;s story, along with the rest, into a full-length cinematic feature. Do these stark accounts truly paint a picture of our fast-changing world and the spoils of globalization over 20 years? Sorrentino admits that they don&#39;t, asserting that it wasn&rsquo;t easy to raise funding for such a long-term project and there was nothing that he could really do. &ldquo;The discipline imposed by the project was to stick firmly to the same children and families picked at the start, no matter what the outcome, so we had to persevere,&rdquo; he explains.<br />\r\n<br />\r\nAnd of course, people are asking, after investing 20 years of periodic filming, will the world see the future chapters of Kay Kay&#39;s life? &ldquo;Absolutely, I want to be there to film what happens next,&rdquo; says Sorrentino.<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<em>Watch Kay Kay - The Girl from Guangzhou on www.aljazeera.com/programmes/witness</em></p>'), ('1', '1', '660', '2', '<p>By Doris Rathgeber<br />\r\n<br />\r\n<span style=\"font-size:14px\">The winter season has finally arrived in the PRD and we feel the cold and humidity not only makes us shiver but actually penetrates deep into our bones. As such, we often prefer to stay indoors where we can<br />\r\nwrap blankets around ourselves and maybe even enjoy the warmth of a fireplace! We tend to be less active in winter and ancient Chinese claim that reduced activity in the winter is better for our health since it helps us live in harmony with the changing seasons. Nature undergoes the changes of yin and yang throughout the year. Yang peaks in the summer and is symbolized by brightness and warmth but yin peaks in the winter and is symbolized by coldness, darkness and humidity. While they peak in different seasons, we need both yin and yang throughout the year for all aspects of our internal and external lives. Yin is associated with specific organs and body functions that need extra support during the winter, and certain warming foods are recommended to stay healthy and protected against colds and flu. Many Chinese medicine specialists recommend eating seasonally and some of our favorite winter foods are lamb, beef, root vegetables and beans in either a soup or stew. You can also add some energizing spices such as garlic, ginger or cinnamon. Last, somewhat bitter flavors are also advisable, and you can add grapefruit, vinegar and even small doses of coffee, tea or wine to your menu. However, during this period you should avoid cooling foods (cucumber, melon, tomatoes) as well as cold drinks, since cooling products interrupt your digestion. While the food you consume can help prevent cold-related illnesses, the Chinese<br />\r\nalso believe in a specific herbal supplement called Gaofang. Once a secret formula for the Chinese imperial court, the mixture has become famous for its capa-vbilities to replenish the qi and blood within both the Chinese and foreign community. The mixture is Individually prepared by a TCM doctor in accordance with each body&rsquo;s constitution and usually consists of 30 to 40 different herbs and minerals. Every December, a big number of Chinese, from young to elderly, visit the doctors and pharmacies to get the syrup that they take twice a day for approximately six weeks. Let us not forget that our emotional state<br />\r\nalso impacts our health and wellbeing in winter. Stress, frustration and emotional turmoil or even a lack of sleep can endanger our immune system. A famous ancient Chinese proverb states that only the<br />\r\ntiger that rests in winter has sufficient power to attack in spring. This can apply to humans as well and by scaling down our activities in wintertime, we can conserve essential physical and emotional energy in order to prepare ourselves for the upcoming springtime.</span></p>'), ('1', '1', '661', '2', '<p>The wait is finally over!

Safety is best</strong>. Kids should always wear a helmet.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>2. Stretch</strong>. Warm up your muscles before hitting the slopes. Stretching off will stop you getting cramp.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>3. Clothes</strong>. Wrap up warm but try not to put on too many clothes. Parents, it may be tempting to use clothes as protection for your child but this will make it hard to move and over-sweating can dehydrate.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>4. Goggles</strong>. A good pair of goggles are better than sunglasses. They not only keep the snow out of your eyes, but make it easier to see the contours of the pistes.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>5. Take it slow</strong>. Even if you think you can head out straight away, take at least one lesson from an instructor just to get some good habits started. It can better for kids to learn from someone outside the family too. It avoids temper tantrums.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>6. Conveyor belts and button lifts</strong>. Always keep your skis pointing forwards, even when looking behind you.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>7. Balance</strong>. When you start skiing, don&rsquo;t lean backwards but not too far forwards either. Try to keep your weight in the center of the skis. This will give you more control.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>8. Falling</strong>. Don&rsquo;t be afraid of falling down. Everybody does it, even the professionals.</p>\r\n\r\n<p><strong>9. Getting up</strong>. If your skis have come off after a fall, make sure to place them horizontal to the direction of the slope when reattaching. Otherwise you might shoot off downhill before you&rsquo;re ready.</p>'), ('1', '1', '663', '2', '<p><span style=\"background-color:rgb(255, 255, 255); color:rgb(62, 62, 62); font-family:calibri; font-size:20px\">On February 8, together with The Canton club, Urbanites Kitchen started this year&rsquo;s first cooking class. </span><span style=\"font-size:20px\"><span style=\"font-family:calibri\">It was another roaring success, with Chef Mark showing our 15 families how to prepare classic osmanthus puddings and eight-treasure rice bowls.

Unfortunately the term often comes with a load of stigma and taboo attached to it, but it doesn&rsquo;t have to. &nbsp;Not only can life be difficult where your family and home is, but there are particular challenges that are unique to an expat or anyone that has ever moved away from the comfort of their hometown or country. Yet, universally there seems to be a stigma about asking for the help you need and seeking that guidance that can help you cope with the new challenges you&rsquo;re facing.</p>\n\n<p>In China there is a general lack of mental health awareness and it can be difficult to find the counseling services you need. However, there are groups here in Shanghai that have taken on the challenge of connecting people to professionals and getting past that initial moment of uncertainty when it comes to seeking counseling.</p>\n\n<p>One organization that is tackling the problem head on is REACH, stemming from the Community Center Shanghai. &nbsp;Nikki Lindgren, one of the founders, explains that its purpose &ldquo;is the coming together of key stakeholders in the community to assess and address the needs and gaps within the health services in Shanghai, with the commitment to giving everyone in the community access to the services they need.&rdquo; Their role is to fill the disparity between health professionals and those who seek counseling, and address the issue that it is simply too difficult to find counseling services here in Shanghai.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"counseling-in-shanghai\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/directions.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p>One of the best counseling outlets you can find in Shanghai is the Community Center Shanghai, which was started in 2003 and has over 20 counselors from all over the world.&nbsp; They are all experienced and properly licensed to conduct counseling sessions. Carrie Jones, the Director of Counseling, explains that their counselors cover all kinds of specialties with a diversity of experience and expertise.&nbsp; The most common reason she finds for expats to seek counseling is relationship problems.&nbsp; Marriage counseling is most commonplace as moving to a different country often puts a strain on marriages. As well as that, infidelity seems to be a problem that is particularly prevalent in Shanghai. &nbsp;Parent to child hardships are the second most common reason people seek counseling at the Community Center, as many children struggle with the high expectations and transitions of their new schools.</p>\n\n<p>Carrie deals with people&rsquo;s anxiety about counseling everyday and tries to break down the stigma that it holds. She explains, &ldquo;Despite what we sometimes think or feel and what society sometimes tells us, seeking help is a sign of strength, not weakness. &nbsp;Many people begin counseling/therapy not because they have any diagnosable mental illness or even any major problem or issue; rather, they do it purely for personal growth and development. &nbsp;Just as some people have a physical trainer to help them enhance their physical fitness level, others like to have a counselor/therapist to help them improve their mental and emotional health and well-being.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>To hear firsthand how counseling has assisted in the adjustment period of moving to China, we sat down with Karen, an expat mother.&nbsp; When her family moved here eight months ago, her son was struggling to settle into his new atmosphere.&nbsp; Going from a small community school in their hometown to a large international school with a diverse and overwhelming population was a big adjustment for him. Although she was comfortable with the idea of counseling, she struggled to find the correct services to help him cope with the change and language barriers. Her main concern when looking for services was the legitimacy of the health network, qualifications, and cost. Luckily her background is in the general field so she knew what to look for; however, she explains, &ldquo;If I didn&rsquo;t have this background, I think it would be a lot harder; I have friends who have said so.&rdquo; After six sessions with a counselor, her son has drastically improved in his ability to manage his new environment, and is now more comfortable in their new city.</p>\n\n<p>Another organization that is changing the face of counseling is Lifeline Shanghai, a non-profit organization. It is an anonymous hotline service in which trained volunteers answer the phone and assist callers in whatever may be troubling them. &ldquo;Talking Helps&rdquo; is Lifeline&rsquo;s mantra, and their mission is to actively listen and help people talk through options. Although they are not an official counseling service, they are able to link callers with a professional, certified counselor whom they feel will be tailored to their needs and finances, always giving at least three referrals.</p>\n\n<p>Coreene Horenko, Outreach Manager at Lifeline, explains that relationship problems are always Lifeline&rsquo;s number one call, whether it is relating to their partner, colleagues, kids, or even an ayi. Often, people call if they are simply having a &ldquo;bad China day&rdquo; and just need someone to listen.&nbsp; Others call because their health insurance does not cover mental health, and they are looking for guidance without the extreme cost. Lifeline sees itself as a frontline service that listens, supports, and connects callers to health services in town.</p>\n\n<p>Slowly but surely, the face of counseling and the mental health field is changing in Shanghai.&nbsp;Organizations such as Lifeline, REACH and the Community Centre Shanghai are taking big strides to make counseling more effective and easier to access, breaking down barriers and changing the minds of people who need help.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>&gt;Lifeline Shanghai, 10am-10pm 365 days per year, Hotline Number: 021 6279 8990</p>\n\n<p>&gt; Community Centre Shanghai,&nbsp;<em>multiple locations</em>, (021 3382-1770, www.commumitycenter.cn)</p>\n</div>'), ('1', '1', '681', '1', '<h3><img alt=\"Robb-adoptable\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/Robb.jpg\" style=\"font-size:13px; height:300px; line-height:1.6em; width:300px\" /></h3>\n\n<div>\n<p>Name: Robb</p>\n\n<p>Gender: Male</p>\n\n<p>DOB: August 2015</p>\n\n<p>Health: Vaccinated, dewormed and deflead.

While there have been reports of some being able to access the site without a VPN, the above screenshot shows what you see when you try to access the Netflix homepage with a Chinese IP address. Users accessing the site without a VPN on are automatically redirected to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.netflix.com/cn/\" target=\"_blank\">netflix.com/cn</a>.</p>\n\n<p>The move to ban VPNs comes as part of an effort by Netflix to show its partner studios and networks that it will protect content and abide by their licensing laws. Said David Fullagar, the company&#39;s vice president of content delivery architecture&nbsp;<a href=\"https://media.netflix.com/en/company-blog/evolving-proxy-detection-as-a-global-service\" target=\"_blank\">in a blog post</a>: &nbsp;&ldquo;Some members use proxies or &lsquo;unblockers&rsquo; to access titles available outside their territory. To address this, we employ the same or similar measures other firms do.&nbsp;This technology continues to evolve and we are evolving with it.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>But will the VPN-detecting technology actually work?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/01/netflixs-vpn-ban-isnt-good-for-anyone-especially-netflix/\" target=\"_blank\">According to Wired</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#39;There&rsquo;s some low hanging fruit they can get,&#39; says Karl Kathuria, the CEO of Psiphon Inc, which&nbsp;<a href=\"https://psiphon.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">runs&nbsp;proxy technologies</a>&nbsp;for users in countries&nbsp;that censor the Internet&nbsp;like Iran and China. &ldquo;If it&rsquo;s a standard VPN with one or ten servers, then it can be pretty easy for them to see what the IP addresses are and block them.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>Netflix could also track whether individual users are regularly logging in from different locations, Kathuria says, which could signal they&rsquo;re using a&nbsp;VPN.</p>\n\n<p>&#39;But once you get past the standard&nbsp;VPN, the ones that have a limited infrastructure, after that, it&rsquo;s going to start to get a bit more difficult,&#39; he&nbsp;says. And the question is whether it will be something they could enforce...</p>\n\n<p>If providers are able to build workarounds, Netflix will have to commit significant energy (and money) to fighting off users who try to keep using them. &#39;It is more or less a game of cat and mouse,&#39; says Andrew Lee, a digital rights activist and the founder of provider&nbsp;Private Internet Access. &#39;The cat catches the mouse. The mouse, in order to get around this, creates 1,000,000 mice and becomes anonymous due to the sheer number of mice.&#39;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Netflix&#39;s predecessors have encountered trouble banning VPNs in the past. Video-streaming site Hulu tried (and failed) to cut off VPN access for users outside the US in 2014. Their measures ultimately didn&#39;t succeed because VPN providers found ways around the restrictions.</p>\n\n<p>There is hope out there, however, as Netflix cofounder Reed Hastings&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.wired.com/2016/01/netflix-just-launched-in-130-new-countries-like-this-morning/\" target=\"_blank\">spoke of plans to expand to China</a>&nbsp;at this month&#39;s&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/12059/chinese-company-unveils-first-passenger-drone\" target=\"_blank\">CES technology convention in Las Vegas</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>&#39;China is obviously a very large country. There are a billion Chinese that we want to give access to Netflix content,&rdquo; Hastings said during a lengthy question and answer session following the event. &ldquo;In China you need specific permission from the government. We&rsquo;re continuing to work on that, and we&rsquo;re very patient.&#39;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Guess you&#39;ll have to keep waiting to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/netflix-and-chill\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix and Chill</a>.

The space has a chic rustic interior with white wooden carved beams throughout the restaurant. It is complete with a red brick patio that provides stunning views of the Bund.

The beef was sat on top a small bed of cauliflower couscous and was cooked in a divine red wine sauce. With a light coconut milk and herb sauce, the cod was another favorite of ours &ndash;&nbsp;every bite seemed to melt in our mouths. The&nbsp;<strong>Porcini Ravioli</strong>&nbsp;(RMB138) had a thin creamy sauce, but is only to be tried by mushroom lovers.</p>\n\n<p>For dessert we opted first for the&nbsp;<strong>Mango Sorbet</strong>&nbsp;(RMB68) but it was a tad too sweet for our taste. However, next came the exquisitely presented&nbsp;<strong>Crystal Ball&nbsp;</strong>(RMB98) &ndash; light, fluffy whipped cream, strawberry sorbet and fresh fruit housed in a translucent white chocolate ball. We definitely preferred the latter to the former.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"napa-wine-bar-dessert\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/Dessert.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Date Night Approved</strong></p>\n\n<p>If you are looking for a romantic, charming place to spend some time with your significant other, this is it. While it may be more on the pricey end, this is the ideal place to celebrate a special occasion or just have a romantic evening.

It will have exercise equipment for the first two weeks and then it turns into a bar for the rest of the year.&rdquo;</em><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">&nbsp;It cracked me up because not only were the senders always (ok mostly) questionable alcoholics at best, but it captured the essence of the enthusiasm with which New Years resolutions are made, and how easily they give way to &lsquo;reality&rsquo; soon after. (By the way, for tips on how to realistically make and keep 2016 resolutions see&nbsp;</span><a href=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/post/how-to-make-and-keep-new-years-resolutions\" style=\"line-height: 1.6em;\" target=\"_blank\">this article</a><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">!).</span></p>\n\n<p>Because the photo-phrase encapsulated this so clearly for me, I made a resolution early on not to stress about resolutions and not to make them. Normally I&rsquo;d hem and haw before coming up with something I&nbsp;<em>should</em>&nbsp;be doing, and make a genuine effort towards it, but this would peter out by mid-year if not earlier. Given that, and our fresh move to Shanghai, I decided that I would go into 2016 embracing it with a blank slate, free of expectations or self-inflicted pressures such as going to the gym on 1 January 2016 (though I did go for a run, yay me!) or to do something I didn&rsquo;t&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;want to do. How liberating yet lazy of me right? Wrong. Ok the lazy part is true, but not setting resolutions this year was actually more liberating in a way I didn&rsquo;t expect - I learnt the all-important difference between resolutions and goals. This may not be news to some of you but it was ground breaking for me as I now know how to manage 2016 and beyond!&nbsp;<u>Resolutions</u>&nbsp;are to alter a (mostly) bad behaviour, whereas&nbsp;<u>goals</u>&nbsp;are setting a positive and achievable target to accomplish. Put another way, a&nbsp;<u>resolution</u>&nbsp;is a decision or determination to do something ongoing whereas a&nbsp;<u>goal</u>&nbsp;is the result toward which effort is directed. There is finality in the latter once the goal is achieved, but the former may not have any ending, which in itself probably sets you up for failure. An example could be&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I want to eat healthier in 2016</em>&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;<em>I&rsquo;m not going to eat out for the whole month of January&rdquo;</em>. The first is general and the second is specific and sets a clearer target including putting you well on the path towards achieving the first.&nbsp;<em>Capiche?</em></p>\n\n<p>Well, that explanation worked for me anyways. It also meant that I had to revise my initial resolution (which was to not have any resolutions) and admit that I was not only lazy, but probably a little narcissistic. What kind of person doesn&rsquo;t have anything they want to change about themselves?! (That explains the weird stares I got when I told people I had a resolution for not making resolutions.) Please put that down to me being overwhelmed.</p>\n\n<p>The point is, now instead of resolutions for a new year, I will set goals. I feel much better about this as a time-frame may be set, and concrete steps taken towards it. For instance, I intend to lose my &lsquo;winter coat&rsquo; weight/holiday weight in three weeks. This entails running or working out every other day - a realistic time frame I&rsquo;ve set within my time limitations. (Hey, I could have said &lsquo;work out everyday&rsquo; but we all know I have a life and that&rsquo;s not going to happen). I haven&rsquo;t for instance, set a goal like&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I will not get angry and hit the roof with my children&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;but I will say that&nbsp;<em>&ldquo;I will count to ten before I erupt all over the place like Mount Vesuvius&rdquo;</em>. &nbsp;This I can even do in Mandarin. Lucky them. So now you get it? That&rsquo;s my 2016 - a whole new era! You even have it in writing.</p>'), ('1', '1', '685', '3', '<p><strong>New Year&#39;s Resolutions are like 6am alarms. Doable? Yes. Likely to happen? Not really.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>For most people, no matter how many times you&rsquo;ve said &ldquo;new year, new me,&rdquo; by the time February rolls around, you&rsquo;ve already completely forgotten about the days marked &ldquo;gym time&rdquo; in your Google Calendar. But hey, it&rsquo;s never too late, right? In keeping with recent health trends, we tried a juice cleanse to wind back the clock and give our bodies a fresh start for the new year.</strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Before we subjected ourselves to drinking our calories, we did some research to make sure no fainting would ensue. Here are some things to keep in mind when juicing:</p>\n\n<p><strong>Give your body some R&amp;R</strong></p>\n\n<p>The whole point of a cleanse is to hit restart on your body and cleanse all the toxins out for a fresh start. It is a transition period where you can put your body on pause to detox and replenish nutrients. This is a time of healing for the body, and strenuous exercise and high activity is ill advised. Postpone those Crossfit classes and opt instead for light jogging, yoga or meditation.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Veggies over fruit</strong></p>\n\n<p>Do not assume all juices are made equal. Yes, fruit is one hundred percent healthy, but most of the nutrition lies in the skin and fibers. Juicing fruit extracts all the vitamins and minerals, but it also does away with the fibers that are essential in the digestion process. As a result, most juices are packed with fructose; and even though the fructose contains vitamins and antioxidants, it is still sugar.</p>\n\n<p>So make sure you read the labels and ingredients, or call a juice company and ask what is going into their juices. You don&rsquo;t want to be paying RMB30-40 on a juice that has four apples and two sprigs of spinach.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cold-pressed is the way to go</strong></p>\n\n<p>Cold-pressed refers to the process of using large amounts of pressure to extract the juice out of fruits and vegetables to preserve all of the vitamins and minerals, ensuring the highest density of nutrients in the extracted juice. Cold-pressed is especially important because as soon as heat comes into play, the concentration of vitamins and nutrients decreases.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Cleansing is not suggested for kids or pregnant women</strong></p>\n\n<p>Pure liquid cleansing is not advised for pregnant women since this is a pivotal time for the body to receive an adequate amount of calories. As for children, there&rsquo;s no reason to say no, but you absolutely do not want to be restricting your child&rsquo;s calorie intake. Raw juices and raw smoothies could also be potentially dangerous for kids, especially if the produce was not washed properly.</p>\n\n<p>Ultimately, adding juices and smoothies is a great way to supplement your diet with nutrients, but the goal should not be weight loss or calorie restriction.</p>\n\n<p>Luckily, there are great, reputable juice companies in Shanghai. If you want to get healthy and get juicing for 2016 (or anytime really), here are our picks.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"lizzie all natural\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/lizzie.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Lizzy&rsquo;s All Natural</strong></p>\n\n<p>Lizzy&rsquo;s All Natural is great for anyone who&rsquo;s new to juicing and looking to kick bad eating habits. What sets Lizzy&rsquo;s apart from other juice companies is that instead of pure liquids, they offer superfood blends. In other words, smoothies.</p>\n\n<p>Unlike juices, which strip the fiber from whole fruits and vegetables, nothing is removed in a smoothie, thereby helping you maintain more consistent blood sugar levels. Plus, smoothies are more substantial than juices, which makes it easier to cleanse without feeling like you&rsquo;ll pass out.</p>\n\n<p>All the produce that goes into Lizzy&rsquo;s smoothies are not only organic, but also washed with a triple filtration system. Even more impressive is how tasty the smoothies are. Our favorites are the Kale and Avocado and Dr. Green, which despite the green color, do not taste like chewing a wad of grass.</p>\n\n<p>&gt;Lizzy&#39;s (www.lizzysallnatural.com)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><img alt=\"vcleanse\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/vcleanse.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>V Cleanse</strong></p>\n\n<p>V Cleanse takes a gourmet approach to juicing, using ingredients such as bitter melon, dandelion, hibiscus, lotus and lemongrass. Though their juices are pricier in comparison, we love the gastronomy meets medicine approach to every V Cleanse bottle. Each bottle is like a slim potion of health.</p>\n\n<p>We tried the Warming Cleanse &ndash; a wonderful option for Shanghai&rsquo;s barely bearable winter &ndash;&nbsp;which is composed of warm and savory raw soups mixed with nut milks and juices. The soups, which are supposed to be warmed before consumption, feel a bit heartier than the average kale juice.</p>\n\n<p>They&rsquo;re also really tasty, especially the pumpkin soup, which tasted more like a warm gourmet appetizer than a blend of raw vegetables. The &ldquo;Purple Broth,&rdquo; mostly made of cabbage, which is great for your lungs, is a dark purple liquid that&rsquo;s actually fun to drink. You could definitely get away with tricking your kid into thinking it&rsquo;s Kool-Aid.</p>\n\n<p>&gt;V Cleanse (www.vcleanse.com)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><img alt=\"farmhouse\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/farmhouse.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Farmhouse Juice</strong></p>\n\n<p>Farmhouse Juice is a great option for those with the willpower to perform a full-on cleanse. Their juices come in 16.9 fluid ounce bottles packed with vitamins, nutrients and flavor, which make not chewing for a day surprisingly doable.</p>\n\n<p>While some juices, like the Green Elixir, are on the earthier side, others are unexpectedly delicious. The Spicy Lemonade has just a kick of cayenne to spike the digestive system, and the ginger-packed Beet It is zingy and tasty, making us feel awake and invigorated.</p>\n\n<p>&gt;Farmhouse (www.farmhousejuice.cn)</p>\n\n<hr />\n<p><img alt=\"fsjuice\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/fsjuice.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>FS Juice</strong></p>\n\n<p>For anyone who&rsquo;s not exactly excited about adopting the diet of a rabbit for a few days, FS Juice is our pick. In fact, FS Juice does not encourage customers to stop eating, but rather advises you supplement a healthy lifestyle with their cold-pressed juices and snacks such as chia seeds and energy balls.</p>\n\n<p>FS Juice has an in-house nutritionist, Jacqueline Zhan Fraise, who develops every recipe and juice pack based on TCM (traditional Chinese medicine) and Western nutrition. One of our favorite FS Juices is the Slimmer, a tall, dark and handsome blend of cucumber, kale, parsley, apple and lemon. Another favorite is the Zen, which is a tasty blend of matcha and nut milks that makes for the perfect breakfast beverage.</p>\n\n<p>As for their juice programs, we tried the Nourishing Detox Pack, which is a two-day pack that comes with a bottle of &ldquo;Restore,&rdquo; &ldquo;Clarity,&rdquo; &ldquo;Zen,&rdquo; &ldquo;Glow&rdquo; and chia seeds. As an entry-level juicer, this pack is perfect because it comes with instructions on what to eat on top of the juices.</p>\n\n<p>&gt;FS Juice (www.fsjuice.com)</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>At the end of the cleanse, we felt like our body had been fortified with enough vitamins, antioxidants, detoxifiers, etc. to last us until 2016.</p>\n\n<p>We have the tendency to be overly ambitious with our health goals, often subjecting ourselves to objectives that are impossible to obtain. We did not shed five pounds after a day of cleansing, but we did become more aware of our bodies and what should go in them for optimal health. The goal of adding juices to your diet should be a healthier lifestyle and not weight loss. Small attainable goals are key to maintaining whatever health resolutions you set for yourself. Happy juicing!</p>'), ('1', '1', '686', '3', '<p>By: Siobhan Brown</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>The Place &amp; Vibe</strong></p>\n\n<p>Walking into Italian eatery Mammamia, diners are immediately welcomed by the restaurant&rsquo;s pleasant warmth and enveloped in the smell of freshly baked dough. Our children were delighted to find a Piaggio Vespa, pizza boxes piled high on the back, as though ready to make a delivery. My friend and I were impressed by the open glass kitchen showcasing an immaculate cooking space and a red-tiled pizza oven. The main eating area boasts wall-to-wall wood floors and rustic wooden tables flanked by chairs and plaid banquettes to comfortably sink into. The space is inviting and has an authentic, warm, Italian feel.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"mammamia food 1\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/MAMMAfood1.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>The Food</strong></p>\n\n<p>Our stomachs growling as soon as we smelled the dough, we were eager to get started. The food is of the highest standard, made with ingredients imported from Italy. Our appetizer, the<strong>&nbsp;Antipasto Misto</strong>(RMB148)<em>,&nbsp;</em>arrived after some fresh baked bread and we were amazed at the sheer variety of the chef&rsquo;s grand selection of meats, cheeses, assorted vegetables and pan-fried starters. We immediately made little sandwiches out of the meat, cheeses and the fresh baked bread, and the kids happily munched on this while we awaited the rest of our meal.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"mammamia food 2\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/mammafood2.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p>Our first main was the&nbsp;<strong>Straccetti Bolognese&nbsp;</strong>(RMB68), cooked perfectly al dente, and served with a generous helping of tasty pork and beef ragu. It must be mentioned that almost all the pasta served at Mammamia is homemade. Between mouthfuls my husband managed to say, &ldquo;meaty&rdquo; while enjoying my leftovers, which were equally tasty the next day. We were then served a signature Mammamia dish that came straight out of the authentic pizza oven. The<strong>&nbsp;Pizza Margherita</strong>&nbsp;(RMB88) boasted beautifully colored ingredients, consisting of buffalo mozzarella, tomatoes, basil and parmesan. The dough was soft and warm and cooked to perfection. The edges were coffee colored and delightfully crispy. Our next main to arrive was the&nbsp;<strong>Merluzzo al Cortoccio&nbsp;</strong>(RMB128)<strong><em>.</em></strong>&nbsp;This savory piece of fish was nestled into white parcel paper that helped seal in all the flavors. The fish inside was so moist and soft that it melted in our mouths like flavorful butter. Our last main to arrive was the<strong>Costoletta Di Maiale Alla Milanese&nbsp;</strong>(RMB138). This pork chop was pan-fried with parmesan cheese, softly breaded and not greasy, having the appearance and taste of a chop that was baked, not fried. It was paired with a tomato and arugula salad that provided the perfect compliment.</p>\n\n<p>As a finale, we had the&nbsp;<strong>Dolce Misto&nbsp;</strong>(RMB98), a mixture of the restaurant&rsquo;s most popular Napolitan desserts. We were treated to a gorgeous array of flaky pastries, vanilla ice cream with a hint of mint, tiramisu with dollops of fresh cream and a generous dusting of cocoa as well as a rich and creamy creme brulee that provided the perfect close to a perfect evening.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"mammamia food 3\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/dessert.jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>Kid Approved</strong></p>\n\n<p>As parents know, it&rsquo;s not always easy to dine with a pint-sized demographic. The staff, however, brought paper and crayons and never even batted an eye when our two three-year-olds climbed under the table to play or knocked over a bottle of sparkling water. The lively atmosphere drowned out their playful pre-school banter as well as their iPads, which my girlfriend and I pulled out so we could enjoy our glass of Prosecco. We never had to wait long for a dish to be served or a plate to be removed, an absolute delight for parents who generally have limited time in a restaurant. While Mammamia is a perfect venue for children, it has a grown-up feel thanks to the pleasing decor, candlelit lighting, excellent wine selection and sophisticated staff. This may just be one of my new favorite restaurants in Shanghai. Chef Enzo Carbone has outdone himself, providing upscale dishes at an affordable price the whole family can enjoy.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Price:</strong>&nbsp;RMB160-180 per person, including children (family-style restaurant, ideal for sharing)</p>\n\n<p><strong>Recommended ages:&nbsp;</strong>All ages</p>\n\n<p><strong>Good for:&nbsp;</strong>Lunch, dinner</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><em>Join Siobhan&rsquo;s family in the next issue of&nbsp;</em>Urban Family<em>&nbsp;as we go on the hunt for kid-friendly dining options around town!</em></p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"family photo\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/family.jpg\" style=\"height:200px; width:150px\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>&gt;&nbsp;</strong>2/F, 1333 Huaihai Zhong Lu, by Changshu Lu, 淮海中路1333号2楼， 近常熟路 (5081 0966 or info@mammamiapizzeria.com.cn)</p>'), ('1', '1', '687', '1', '<div>\n<div>\n<p><span style=\"font-size:16px\"><strong>From Jan 4: Sherlock - The Abominable Bride</strong></span></p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"sherlock\" src=\"http://shanghai.urban-family.com/uploads/galleries/images/jan4-sherlockfilm(1).jpg\" style=\"width:750px\" /></strong></p>\n\n<p>The BBC modernization of the enterprising sleuth has struck a major chord on the Mainland, sparking<a href=\"http://www.thatsmags.com/china/post/4464/china-is-cracking-down-on-gay-sherlock-fan-fiction\" target=\"_blank\">a sadly banned genre of online fan fiction</a>.

Urgent cases may see a result in less than 24 hours. If the abuser violates the protection order, he or she will be fined up to RMB1,000 and/or detained for 15 days. Serious offenses will be tried accordingly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>The legislation includes protection for those who are not related but living together, namely, guardianship and foster-care relationships.&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/china-gay-couples-violence_56801281e4b014efe0d86ee5\" target=\"_blank\">Same-sex couples, however, are not protected under the law</a>&nbsp;&ndash; a reflection of China&rsquo;s longstanding refusal to acknowledge homosexuality on the mainland.</p>\n\n<p>For years, human rights activists and women&rsquo;s groups have criticized China&rsquo;s dearth of domestic violence laws, citing the inordinate number of abuse cases each year. In 2014,&nbsp;<em>Xinhua</em>&nbsp;reported 23,000 cases in Zhejiang province alone.

More than 800 single-estate fine harvest teas and exclusive blends are painstakingly handpicked. Stored in flamboyant artisan tins on wood-paneled sliding walls that surround hardwood tables, the brews are gently concocted on an old-fashioned tea counter by trained connoisseurs, accompanied by fine bone china and an 18-karat gold teapot.</p>\n\n<p>If the attention to aesthetic detail is already making you swoon with desire, the tea-infused gastronomy will surely send you over the edge with lust.

The lobster timbale (RMB200) is a deep sphere of marinated lobster and avocado sprinkled with coriander and chives, then drizzled with a to-die-for Love Me tea-infused vinaigrette.

I like the way that Emilie de Ravin, who plays Belle in Maleficent, carries herself and the clothes she wears, like longer skirts. My style is more fancy, but I also like to be comfortable when I&#39;m home. I don&#39;t think that style lasts forever, it will change as you grow older.</p>\n\n<p>Edward, aged 11 - Grade 6</p>\n\n<p>Fashion is not about looking good but about showing your creativity. I consider my mom to be my mentor when it comes to fashion because when I can&#39;t make a decision on what to wear or what is suitable, she always has the right answer. I like casual, simple styles, but on special occasions, I opt for nice denim pants and long T-shirts &ndash; that is what I really like to wear. I agree that fashion trends will change, but your style will always be the same.</p>\n\n<p>Purity, aged 7 - Grade 4</p>\n\n<p>I like to express my feeling with clothes and no one should feel bad about your own fashion. Zendaya, the singer and dancer, has great fashion, and she follows who she is. I feel like my style is more like comfortable and tomboyish, but I still want to feel like a girl. The older you get, I think you forget about the older fashions that were popular, but my style will probably always be the same &ndash; it&#39;s who I am.</p>\n\n<p>Julia, aged 8 - Grade 3</p>\n\n<p>Fashion simply is the clothes that I wear and what others wear. I look up to my mom because she likes to dress up and looks beautiful. I like dresses, mostly, wearing hairpins and lots of color. A colorful style is my style. I agree that style is eternal &ndash; your style will always be the same, but fashion today may not be the fashion of tomorrow.</p>\n\n<p>Amml, aged 10 - Grade 5</p>\n\n<p>Fashion means dressing the way you want and choosing different styles of outfits. My mom chooses lots of colors that match, those that mix and match, and knows what looks good on me. She always looks for that perfect combination. I feel that the style of matching colors will never fade, but the clothes that you wear will show your individuality.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Raghd, aged 10 - Grade 5</p>\n\n<p>I like clothes that are comfortable and with more dark colors, so that&#39;s the fashion that works for me. My friends and I talk about different fashions, so I look up to their advice. They like to wear fancy and colorful clothes, which is what I like, too. I think that the fashion of colors will always change, but my style and the type of clothes that I wear will never change.</p>\n\n<p>This is a collection of poems written by our young students in the PRD.

It can be anything from a muscle strain to chronic injuries of the hip joint itself. Muscle strains around the hip joint will have similar symptoms to muscle strains to other parts of the body. Usually after a sudden, fast or high-impact movement you will experience immediate sharp pain. Over a few hours, this will also cause muscle tightness and stiffness to the entire region. Commonly strained muscle groups that affect the hips would include hip flexors, adductors and hamstrings. However, chronic groin pain can sometimes be associated with hip joint injuries. Pain within the hip joint is most often, but not always, experienced in the groin. Pain over the outside of the hip is usually not caused by a hip joint problem, and is more commonly related to hip bursitis or a pinched nerve in the back. Patients with hip problems usually complain of groin pain. This is called &quot;referred pain,&quot; and it is due to the organization of nerves in our body.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Types of hip injuries and treatment</strong></p>\n\n<p>One common type of hip joint injury is Femoral Acetabular Impingement (FAI). FAI may affect the hip joint in young and middle-aged adults and occurs when the ball-shaped femoral head rubs abnormally or does not permit a normal range of motion in the acetabular socket. Damage can occur to the articular cartilage or labral cartilage (soft tissue bumper of the socket), or both. FAI-related pain is often felt in the groin, but may also be experienced in the lower back or around the hip. Patients can also feel clicking, grinding or stiffness in the joint. Joint stiffness is often described as needing to &ldquo;pop the hip to make it feel better.&rdquo; Patients with FAI will also report discomfort with prolonged hip flexion activities like sitting. Diagnosis is commonly made by testing the range of motion for the hip and can be confirmed with diagnostic imaging. Typically, the first type of intervention would be oral anti-inflammatory medication and physical therapy. The initial goals would be reduce pain and inflammation, followed up by increasing strength of the hip joint and lumbar pelvic stability. In more severe cases of FAI direct steroid injection or surgical intervention will be required to fix the problem.</p>\n\n<p>Another type of hip injury is a labral tear. The labrum is a type of cartilage that surrounds the socket of ball-and-socket joints. A labrum is found in both the shoulder and the hip joint. The labrum forms a ring around the edge of the bony socket of the joint. It helps to provide stability to the joint by deepening the socket, yet unlike bone, it also allows flexibility and motion. There are two general types of hip labral tears: degenerative tears and traumatic injuries. A degenerative tear is a chronic injury that occurs as a result of repetitive use and activity. Degenerative labral tears can be seen in the early stages of hip arthritis. A traumatic hip labral tear is usually an acute injury as a result of a sports injury, fall, or accident. Hip labral tears can be seen in association with episodes of hip dislocation or subluxation. They are commonly associated with sudden, twisting maneuvers that cause immediate pain in the hip. It can be difficult to diagnose. Many of the symptoms are similar to symptoms of a groin strain, snapping hip syndrome, sports hernia or other athletic injuries of the hip joint. Furthermore, just because a tear is seen in the hip labrum on an MRI, it does not mean the tear is necessarily the cause of the pain. As with an impingement injury, common conservative treatment would be oral anti-inflammatory medicines in conjunction with physical therapy, with more invasive treatment being steroid injections and ultimately surgical intervention.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000CD\">// Erick Chen is an MA and Athletic Trainer at United Family Guangzhou Clinic, 1/F, Annex, PICC Bldg, 301 Guangzhou Dadao Zhong, Yuexiu District, Guangzhou 广州市越秀区广州大道中301号人保大厦南塔副楼首层<br />\n(4008 919 191, 24-hour Urgent Care: (020) 8710 6060</span></p>'), ('1', '1', '709', '2', '<p><strong><em>By Dr. Li De Zhi</em></strong></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p><strong>What is anorexia?</strong></p>\n\n<div>Anorexia nervosa is a serious, often chronic, and life-threatening eating disorder characterized by a distorted body image and self-starvation despite extremely low body-weight. People with anorexia place a high value on controlling their weight and shape, using extreme efforts that tend to significantly interfere with activities in their lives.</div>\n\n<div>&nbsp;</div>\n\n<p><strong>What are the types of anorexia?</strong></p>\n\n<p>It can be divided into infantile anorexia and adolescence anorexia. Infantile anorexia is related to improper feeding times and bad eating habits. For example, not eating regularly is an issue. You won&#39;t have an appetite if you eat snacks or candy before a meal. One must always have something in your stomach so that blood sugar levels do not drop.</p>\n\n<p>Adolescent anorexia is more common in women who are excessively pursuing a slim figure. It occurs in women, and tends to start between the ages of 13 to 25 years old. Because of the long-term eating control, some people even try to constantly stimulate the pharynx with their fingers in order to spit the food out. This disrupts the normal nerve reflex artificially, and leads the brain to no longer get stimulated when seeing food. The reduction of secretion of digestive juices, peristalsis of stomach and slowing down of the bowel &ndash; all of these are reasons why people suffering from anorexia don&rsquo;t feel hungry when they see food. Instead, they feel disgusted and sick. Consequently, it affects the pathological nerve reflex. Anorexia is often accompanied by changes in personality, malnutrition, decrease of cardiac function and metabolic and endocrine disorders. For example, the female suffers from amenorrhea. Around 5 to 15 percent of people die from issues like cardiac complications, multiple organ failure, secondary infections and suicide.</p>\n\n<p><strong>How to treat and prevent adolescent anorexia?</strong></p>\n\n<p>For patients who haven&rsquo;t eaten food for a long time, their gastrointestinal function will weaken. So when having food, one should start with a soft diet, or more meals but in smaller quantities. If you eat excessively at one time, you will feel bloated and have abdominal pain. You should take oral medicine to improve appetite and digestive function. Some people with light symptoms can use traditional Chinese medicine to nourish the spleen and the stomach. One must also get enough sleep to ease psychological pressure and use zinc supplementation therapy to increase the appetite. Severe cases will require medicines to correct water electrolyte disorder and malnutrition. The use of behavior therapy and psychotherapy will also help patients, especially those who are above 18 and whose history of the disease exceeds three years. Those who cannot be helped by medicine and therapy can resort to surgery, although it is often not needed. A balanced diet, good habits and enough sleep can help you to prevent anorexia.</p>'), ('1', '1', '710', '2', '<p><em><strong>By Jenny Ostermiller</strong></em></p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>As much as I would like to say that this kind of thing is an isolated incident, I recognize through my work as a school counselor and my experiences as a woman who doesn&rsquo;t live in a cave devoid of media influences that this is typical. I would venture to guess that most women (and the majority of men) can quickly list off all of the physical flaws they possess &ndash; muffin top, cellulite, too much junk in the trunk, thunder thighs &ndash; the list goes on and on. Most of us have tried some kind of diet or exercise regimen to remedy our issues. Most of us fail. A 10-day juice cleanse rarely leads to one feeling good about themselves in the long term. But again and again, we hop on the treadmill of diet advice and exercise fads hoping that the next big trend will lead to a romping on the beach in a tiny bikini, <em>America&rsquo;s Next Top Model</em> style.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>So how do we, as human beings, and especially women, regain the right to feel good about our bodies? Is there a magic pill or workout move that can solve all of our diet and size woes? My answer is an empathetic no. There is no magic. There is no quick fix. However, there is hope.</p>\n\n<p>My own experience in the last year has taught me that when we eat healthful, nutritious food we can transform how we feel about our bodies and how we feel in general. My own journey this year saw what some would consider a radical change in the way I eat and view food. For me, adopting whole foods and a plant-based diet (with no animal products or added oil) has helped me to understand and appreciate the gift of a healthy body and mind in a way that I couldn&rsquo;t imagine before. By fueling my body with real foods that haven&rsquo;t been processed or refined beyond recognition, I have finally developed a relationship with my body that I am happy with. I no longer look in the mirror seeking flaws. Rather, I understand that taking care of myself leads to a host of physical and emotional benefits, including feeling good about how I look in my skinny jeans. The best thing we can do for ourselves or as parents and role models to children is to seek out good health and stop looking for quick fixes. By truly nourishing ourselves with our food rather than chasing a certain size through, we can&rsquo;t help but change the way we view our bodies.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>Jenny Ostermiller is in her fifth year as the middle school counselor at the American International School of Guangzhou.

The therapeutic use of water, or balneotherapy, could be just what the doctor ordered when it comes to relieving pain, stress, skin woes and more. The water found in natural hot springs contains a variety of different minerals, including calcium and sodium bicarbonate. When you bathe in a hot spring, your skin soaks in these minerals and your hydrostatic pressure rises. As this process continues, circulation and oxygen flow increases, much like when you exercise. An oxygenated circulatory system is beneficial in keeping not only your heart, but also your body&rsquo;s other vital organs and tissues, healthy and strong.

Eighty-two items were studied and traces of toxins were found in all but six. The study confirms that the use of hazardous chemicals is still widespread &ndash; even during the manufacture of clothes for children and infants. Let that sink in for a moment. Yikes.<br />\n<br />\nThe chemicals detected included hormone-disrupting nonylphenol ethoxylates and phthalates, reproductive and immune toxins in the perfluorochemicals family, and antimony (a material similar to arsenic and organotins), which can damage immune and nervous systems. Greenpeace said that while amounts were small and there&rsquo;s no evidence that children wearing the items would be harmed, precaution nevertheless called for an end to their use in textile production. But until manufacturers change their ways, here&rsquo;s a few things parents can do:<br />\n<br />\n&bull;If you buy something that you suspect is toxic (like it smells bad), wash it, wash it, wash it! The more you wash it, the more the toxins will be removed.<br />\n<br />\n&bull;Just say no to sandals, shoes, boots or raingear made entirely or predominantly from rubber or plastic-like materials.

Your hairstylist may be a magician, but psychic they are not. In the imperfect real world that we live in, we walk into a hair salon, all dressed up and living in a fantasy to look a certain way, and then often leave frustrated at our hairdresser, wishing he or she had a bit more knowledge to make you look the way you want. But whose fault is it really?</p>\n\n<p>Joseph Fernandes, owner and stylist at Joseph Fernandes Hair Studio, works in both Guangzhou and Dongguan, and has plenty of experience with non-Asian hair, which often tends to suffer more in the weather we have here. A Brazilian native, Joseph was kind enough to share what hairstylists wish you knew before you walked through the door and&nbsp; sat down in their chairs. Prepare to be (re)educated, folks. Here&rsquo;s to a more fashionable you.</p>\n\n<p>1) Stylists cannot read your mind. If you want to change what has been happening, then talk to them. Show photos, and tell them what you want. Remember that while you may not get exactly what any picture shows, they are infinitely helpful in guiding the stylist. Just don&#39;t keep quiet because you&#39;re afraid to voice your opinion. This is your head, and a stylist&#39;s end goal is for you to be happy.</p>\n\n<p>2) If you&#39;re not protecting your hair at home, you&#39;re making your life harder than it should be. Stylists want you to use a hydrating hair mask (either store-bought or even homemade) once a week. This is especially true if you&#39;re planning an extreme shift, such as from black to blonde. Apply your mask of choice to towel-dried hair three inches down from the roots, then work through to the ends and leave it on for 20 minutes. Voila.</p>\n\n<p>3) Using permanent dye does not mean that your hair color will be brighter, last longer, or stay in better than it would with semi-permanent dye. Permanent color lifts and takes out original hair color and deposits new color in. Semi-permanent dye does not lift out color &ndash; it only adds/deposits new color. Both dye types fade equally fast. For pre-colored ends, you don&#39;t need permanent dye, because the natural color has already been lifted out. Only use permanent dye on roots and grays. Use semi-permanent dye to freshen up all-over color. It is less damaging, lasts longer, and is way shinier. And your stylist will be happy, because you won&#39;t walk in with a home hair dye disaster.</p>\n\n<p>4) If you have dark brown or black hair, and want to go silver or pastel, it&#39;s going to take a lot of love and a lot of work. If you have ever dyed your hair dark, even if it was years ago, the ends are not untouched hair. If you have dyed it more than once, you have layers of color that need to come off. Don&#39;t be scared if the first two layers of bleaching result in a yellow-looking funk. Be patient. It&#39;s a process.</p>\n\n<p>The main point Joseph stresses here is that people in the PRD, especially if they are new to the city and not used to hairstylists and the way they work in China, should be prepared for how long certain things might take, what the costs may be and what maintenance will entail. Do a little research so that you have realistic expectations.</p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#0000CD\">If you want to get your hair cut and styled by Joseph, add him on WeChat: josephdongguan</span></p>'), ('1', '1', '719', '5', '<p><em>By Christine Gilbert</em></p>\n\n<p>On October 24, 200 kids and their families from Buena Vista Concordia International School (BCIS) celebrated international cultures as part of their annual UN Day celebration.

It was almost taboo to be fashionable and show off the curve of the belly&ndash;and shape of the body&ndash;while pregnant. China is still behind the times for a number of other reasons as well. The one-child policy made women secretive about their pregnancies, looking to hide a bump, not show it off. Also, very strangely, &ldquo;anti-radiation&rdquo; clothing has been a huge trend in maternity wear, exclusively in China and a few other Asian countries. There&rsquo;s zero proof that it works, but women here tend to wear relatively fashionable versions of the metal aprons you put on when getting an X-ray. Forty percent of maternity wear in China is still marketed as &ldquo;radiation proof&rdquo;.</p>\n\n<p>Blogger Ruth Silbermayr-Song was encouraged to try this fashion for another reason. On her blog, China Elevator Stories, a friend encouraged her to wear the signature clothing to get a seat in the subway. Terribly nauseated, but not showing her bump yet, she wanted a way to be recognized as pregnant.

So, what&rsquo;s a pregnant foreign lady to do?</p>\n\n<p>H&amp;M is a go to for many women.

You are your child&rsquo;s advocate, while agents often simply care about money and others might see your child as a prop. Be sure to negotiate every single detail beforehand. If an agent says the job is three hours, be sure they don&rsquo;t expect you on set for 12 hours and only shooting for three.

Programme</h1>\n\n<p>YCIS has offered Chinese learning since the school was established in 1932. As a visionary led international school, YCIS strives to unite the best elements of Eastern and Western traditions and practices. Learning Chinese language and culture in Yew Chung helps to open doors for our students to learn about the Eastern world, fusing cross cultural thinking and open-mindedness.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Students learn to read, write and speak fluently in Putonghua through curricula tailored for both native and non-native speakers. The Chinese Language and Culture Programme runs from Kindergarten all the way through to graduation and help students attain a strong command of the Chinese language after two to three years.<br />\n<br />\nWithin each Kindergarten and Primary School classroom, two fully qualified Co-Teachers, one Western and one Chinese, work together at teaching and share all responsibilities over the care and education of students in class. They plan and work together to provide students with a variety of learning experiences and help students develop English and Chinese communication skills in a bi-cultural and fully immersive bilingual environment.</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chinese as a First Language (CFL)&nbsp;</h1>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"line-height:1.6em\">In addition to training up students&#39; basic skills of listening, speaking, reading and writing, CFL also grooms students to have awareness and understanding of Chinese culture. The programme emphasises the nurture of students&rsquo; interest in learning Chinese language, good study habits and self-learning ability as well as providing the opportunities for students to take the initiative to explore and engage in team learning so as to inspire students&#39; rich imagination, creativity, visual thinking skills, logical thinking ability and appreciative capability. In that way, students can create a positive, diverse and healthy life.</span></p>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chinese as an Additional Language (CAL)</h1>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Chinese as an Additional Language not only stimulates students&#39; interest in learning Chinese, but also allows them to be exposed to and understand Chinese traditional and modern cultures. This programme focuses on training students&#39; ability to grasp preliminary Chinese, for example conversation with others in Chinese, recognising Chinese characters (including pronunciation, strokes, explanation, and usage), mastery of verbal vocabulary, and reading Chinese articles and books at a general level.</p>\n\n<h1 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Chinese Studies</h1>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\"><span style=\"color:rgb(77, 77, 77)\">Chinese Studies is a programme YCIS Shanghai developed in 2013 and is a regular programme from Year 1 to Year 9 students. The learning topics integrate subjects from history and geography to visual art, performing arts and music. The programme has a strong focus both on today&#39;s China and China&#39;s culture heritage, and it is designed to emphasise student&rsquo;s participation and focuses on hands-on experiences. Not only does YCIS Shanghai provide Chinese language studies at various levels, but it also organises cultural field trips, Chinese culture workshops, and traditional festival celebrations and events for the students.</span></p>\n', '<h1 style=\"text-align:justify\">Visit Our School!</h1>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">The best way to get to know our school is to come meet with one of our friendly Admissions team members!</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">School tours are offered Monday through Friday, and normally last about one hour. The optimal time to experience our school is to visit between 9a.m. and 3p.m. (or before 11a.m. for Kindergarten), so you can see the students in action!<br />\n<br />\nClick on the pictures below to find out which campus is most convenient for your child.</p>\n\n<h1>Application Process</h1>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:justify\">Thank you for selecting YCIS Shanghai to partner with you in preparing your child for a competitive and multicultural world!
